For 1.0.0
==========

 (see mailing list for the details, this is just a reminder list)

Stuff that's fairly easy (we think)
-----------------------------------

 * pep8 cleanup
 * reduce the number of FIXME's and TODO's in the code base
 * More Error handling/reporting
   - Include version number and other such useful info in the exception dialog
 * Cluster Plugin Speed-up
 * Automate mirroring help to the wiki
 * Add more keyboard shortcuts
 * Right-click context menus
 * Write a script for tagging releases from a branch and generating release notes.
 * TWD plugin (initial version down - functionality needs improvement)

Bugfixes
--------

Needs planning
--------------

 * Card Requirements
    - Requires versus provided for disciplines & clan cards ?
       - each card provides a set of keywords
       - each card potentially requires one of a list of keyword sets.
       - Multiple discipline requirements ?
       - Requires (anarch, titled, prince, etc.)
       [ implement a plugin which can filter out what a set of crypt
         cards can play first ]
 * Replace PyProtocols with something else
 * Real Plugin System
 * Abstract Card Editor
 * Stripped down UI for smart-phones

For the future
===============

Backend:
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Consider using SQLObject's new .throughTo method for populating / caching
   the objects abstract cards join to.

Code Cleanup
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing (partly done, could use further work)
 * More tests
 * Make MultiSelectCombo less evil (turn it into a proper widget?)

Gui (Functionality):
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Convert the repeated functions in the plugins into functions in the plugin
   API
 * Improved card set sorting
   - Allow specifying order of columns to use, etc.
 * Add an undo stack for card set and filter editing operations
 * Allow colouring options for the cards
   (use-case for this?)

Gui (Presentation):
 * Clean up the card set controller/model/view interactions
   - CardSetManagement stuff is still rather tangled
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Disable set_fixed_height_mode on TreeView cells so that the card text extra column
   can be changed to render across multiple lines without breaking layout. This
   will require some other way of dealing with the TreeView jumping bug.

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.

Upstream:
 * File GTK bugs for:
   - TreeView jumping.
