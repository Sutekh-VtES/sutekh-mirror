For 0.8.0 cycle
 
 (see mailing list for the details, this is just a reminder list)

 - Postponed
    - Requires versus provided for disciplines & clan cards ?
       - each card provides a set of keywords
       - each card potentially requires one of a list of keyword sets.
       - Multiple discipline requirements ?
       - Requires (anarch, titled, prince, etc.)
       [ implement a plugin which can filter out what a set of crypt
         cards can play first ]

 - Done
    + Remove/Relax limits in the database (Card set names, etc.)
    + Add PhysicalCard and AbstractCard to the CardListModel columns.
    - Parts of add more info to the database:
          - Migrate burnoption to keyword.
          - Base bleed, strength, stealth, intercept keywords
              - "0 bleed", "1 bleed", "2 bleed", etc.
              - "0 strength", "1 strength", "X strength", etc.
              - "1 stealth", "1 intercept".
          - Master keywords (trifle, out-of-turn, discipline, location, etc.)
          - Equipment keywords (gun, melee weapon, vehicle, etc.)
          - Parse artist info from the cardlist
          - Ally/Retainer life ?
              - Put base ally / retainer life into existing life column.
    + Standardise the reader/writer design for the io files. 
       + Parser: .__init__(), .parse(fIn, oHolder)
       + Writer: .__init__(), .write(fOut, oHolder)

 - Definite
    * Improve Filter Edit Dialog
    + Add more info to the database. At least some of
       + Additional keywords (somewhat done)
          - Corner cases for keywords (Ghoul retainer strength, High Top
            intercept, etc.)
    * Add decent error checking for the io files
    * Redo preferences system. Allow finder grained preferences (save
      groupings, etc per card set)
    * Add automatic detection of file type for import plugin (doesn't have to
      be perfect, but should do OK in most cases)
    * More access to debugging info
      - Make it easier to get relevant info from users
      - Use logging module to store more info, to be easily extracted
      - Do more with the --verbose flag?
    * Improved card set sorting
      - Allow specifying order of columns to use, etc.
    * Use card set list view widget in place of long card set name lists
      everywhere
    * Don't set dates in the expected io results at import time to avoid test
      failures when the test run crosses midnight.

    Website:
       * Mirror documentation on website. (sort of done, needs automating)

 - Nice to have
    * Add ways of specifying more limited test data sets
    * Add better persistence of data across tests, to avoid rerunning the 
      parser for each test and improve test runtime
    * Address code duplication issues - especially io module & Filter tests (largely done)
    * Abstract Card Editor
    * Real plugin support
      - and mechanism for plugins to provide their own documentation to the
        help menu.
    * Cluster plugin speed-up
    * Add support for creating .debs and .rpms
    * Improve the error & warnings dialogs. 
      - include exception backtrace in error dialogs
    * Add more keyboard shortcuts
    * Right-click context menus
    * Make MultiSelectCombo less evil (turn it into a proper widget?)

* Post 0.8
  * Allow colouring options for the cards

For the future
--------------

Backend:
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Consider using SQLObject's new .throughTo method for populating / caching
   the objects abstract cards join to.
 * Use sqlobject 0.10's view support to work around mysql's poor subselect
   performance

Code Cleanup
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
   - Common base class for the TreeViews?
 * More tests
 * MultiPaneWindow mixes code for handling the widget hopping and application
   code - these should be seperated.

Gui (Functionality):
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Convert the repeated functions in the plugins into functions in the plugin 
   API

Gui (Presentation):
 * Cleanup various dialogs, including
   * Unify some of the other dialogs and make various bits more reusable 
     (cf. CreateCardSetDialog hack in plugins)
 * Clean up the card set controller/model/view interactions
   - CardSetManagement stuff is still rather tangled
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Disable set_fixed_height_mode on TreeView cells so that the card text extra column
   can be changed to render across multiple lines without breaking layout. This
   will require some other way of dealing with the TreeView jumping bug.

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.

Upstream:
 * File GTK bugs for:
   * TreeView jumping.
   * TreeView search pop-up not working under Windows.
