30 April 2008
 * Fix PhysicalCardSet filter to join on the card id, not the card set id.
 * PhysicalCard list is no longer editable, and doesn't show numbers any more
 * Re-enable the ExtraColumns plugin on the PCL
 * Fix zip file handling so backups of the new database structure can be
   restored
 * Rework IdentifyXMLFile, so old + new backups can work properly
 * Add parent support to PhysicalCardSetWriter + Parser
 * Rename 'Physical Card Set List' to 'Card Set List'
 * Make DatabaseUpgrade work on version 0.4 databases again

29 April 2008
 * Database redesign day
   Move from PhysicalCard List as he card collection to card collection is
   a physical card set with subsets model.
   - Removed AbstractCardSet's entirely
   - Added parent field on Physical Card Sets
   - Create 1 PhysicalCard for each valid AbstractCard + Expansion combination
     (Includes Expansion=None for all cards)
 * Database upgrade extended
 * Various obselete files remove (AbstractCardSetWriter, PhysicalCardWriter)
 * Reworked file IO to handle new database schema
 * Tests reworked to new database schema
 * Change the card set list to a treeview, which can show parent->child
   relationships
 * clean out ACS and PCL code from the zip file handler
 * Clean ou ACS references in the plugins
 * Change PhysicalCardSet Models to use the mapping table, so distinct() on
   the select works properly, since the PhysicalCard id's are no longer unique.
   Same reasoning as previous such hack on AbstractCardSets.
 * Created sutekh-last-of-the-abstract-card-sets-april-2008 tag for tree state
   before database rework
