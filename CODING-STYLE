=== Coding Style ===

Sutekh follows PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code [1] with the following
choices, exceptions, additions and clarifications:

 * Variable names use Hungarian notation with a single letter prefix.
   The prefixes are:
     sMoo (string)
     iMoo (int)
     fMoo (float or file handle)
     aMoo (list)
     tMoo (tuple)
     dMoo (dictionary)
     oMoo (complex object)

=== Regular Expressions for Matching Bad Style ===

 * Assignments without spaces around equals:
   r'^\s*[A-Za-z0-9.]+=[A-Za-z0-9.]+(\([^()]*\))?$'
