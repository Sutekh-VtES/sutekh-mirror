<h2 id="intro">The Initial Layout</h2>

<p>When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following 4 panes.</p>

<ul>
<li>White Wolf Card List</li>
<li>Card Text</li>
<li>Card Set List</li>
<li>My Collection</li>
</ul>

<p>On subsequent runs, the list of panes to show will be read from file. You 
can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout 
using <strong>Save current pane set</strong> from the <strong>File->Preferences</strong>, or by letting the  
<strong>Save Pane Set on Exit</strong> option save the configuration.</p>

<h3>The White wolf card list</h3>

<p>Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the 
<em>White Wolf Card List</em>. This lists all the cards, and, for each card, the 
expansions it has appeared in.</p>

<h3>Card Text</h3>

<p>The pane displays the information about the currently selected card.</p>

<h3>Card Sets</h3>

<p>Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be 
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets 
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called <em>My Collection</em> 
is created, to hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h3>My Collection</h3>

<p>This card set will hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h2 id="cards">Working with Cards</h2>

<h3>Adding cards to a card set</h3>

<p>Card Sets are, by default, not editable, unless they are empty. This can be 
changed by toggling the <strong>Card Set is Editable</strong> menu entry in the <strong>Edit</strong> Menu 
of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a card 
set, ensure it is editable.</p>

<p>Cards can be added by dragging them from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em> to the pane 
for the card set. Selecting multiple cards will add a single copy of each 
selected cards. You can also use the copy &amp; paste options from the edit menu.</p>

<p>When a card set is editable, <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons will be shown next to the card 
names. These can be used to increase or decrease the number for a given card.</p>

<p>The number can also be changed using the keyboard: &#8217;+&#8217; and &#8217;-&#8217; will 
increment and decrement counts, while the numbers 1 to 9 can be used to set 
the count for the given card to that value.</p>

<p>You can also copy or drag-n-drop cards from other card sets. Unlike copying  
from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em>, copying from another card sets will copy all  
the selected cards.</p>

<h3>Removing cards</h3>

<p>Cards can be removed from a card set either by using the <strong>-</strong> button shown in 
the card set pane next to the card name, using the keyboard shortcuts to change 
the number of cards, or by selecting cards and using the <strong>Delete selection</strong> 
option from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<h2 id="panes">Manipulating Panes</h2>

<p>The Sutekh user interface consists of panes. The number of panes and the layout 
is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Panes can be added using the <strong>Add Pane</strong> Menu, while the contents of the 
currently selected pane can be replaced using the <strong>Replace Pane</strong> Menu. New 
blank panes can also be added by splitting the current pane, either into 
two panes next to each other, or into two panes stacked one above the other. 
Panes can be swapped by dragging a pane to it&#8217;s new location.</p>

<p>Card sets will be opened in a new pane added on the right by double clicking 
on the entry in the <em>Card Set</em> list. Card sets can also be opened in a specific 
pane by dragging the card set name from the <em>Card Set</em> list to the desired 
pane.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Save Pane Set on Exit</strong> option in the <strong>File->Preferences</strong> menu is 
set, Sutekh will save the current layout when you exit, and restore it on 
startup. You can also save the current layout using the <strong>Save Current Pane Set</strong> 
option.</p>

<p>Panes are removed from the list by closing them from the 
<strong>Pane Actions->Remove current pane</strong> menu option (or the associated keyboard 
shortcut). Card Set panes will also be closed if you delete the card set.</p>

<h2 id="sets">Managing Card Sets</h2>

<h3>Creating a new card set</h3>

<p>A new card set can be created from the <em>Card Set List</em>, using *Create New 
Card Set* option from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu. The name is required, and must be 
unique. A Card set can either have <em>No Parent</em>, in which case it is a stand 
alone card set, or you can choose any existing card set as the parent, in 
which case it is a subset of that card set.</p>

<h3>Renaming a card set.</h3>

<p>A card set can be renamed using the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> option 
from the card set list&#8217;s <strong>Actions</strong> Menu. An open card set can also be renamed 
via the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> Menu of the card set.</p>

<h3>Changing the parent of a card set.</h3>

<p>The parent of a card set can by changed via the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> 
option from the <strong>Actions</strong> Menu, or by dragging the selected card set onto it&#8217;s 
new parent in the card set list pane.</p>

<h3>Deleting a card set</h3>

<p>Card sets can by deleted via the <strong>Delete card set</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu of 
the card set list pane. Open card sets can also be deleted via the *Delete card 
set* option from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu of the card set pane.</p>

<h3><em>&#8220;In Use&#8221;</em> Card sets</h3>

<p>Card sets can be marked or unmarked as <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>. The set of in use card sets 
are considered to be those currently active. The display modes dealing with 
child card sets only consider child cards sets that are marked as <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>.</p>

<h3>The Different card display and count modes</h3>

<p>Sutekh has several options which control which cards are displayed for a  
card set, and what information about the cards is displayed.</p>

<p>The cards to display are also affected by the <a href="#filtering">filters</a> that are 
applied.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Cards to Show&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>This option, controls which cards are displayed.</p>

<p>The default mode shows only those card that belong to the actual card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show All Cards&#8221; shows the entire list of cards. This mode is often useful 
when entering cards into a card set for the first time</p>

<p>&#8220;Show all cards in parent card set&#8221; shows the combination of the card in this 
card set and all the cards in the parent card set. It is useful for seeing 
which cards are available for adding to a deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show all cards in child card sets&#8221; shows all cards that belong to the 
<em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> children of this card set in addition to the cards in this card 
set.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Display Mode&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>This controls what information is displayed below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Expansions&#8221;, the default, shows which cards have been marked as belonging 
to which expansions below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show No Children&#8221; disables anything below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Child Card Sets&#8221; shows the allocation of cards to the <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> children 
of the current card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Expansions + Child Card Sets&#8221; shows the expansions as for 
&#8220;Show Expansions&#8221;, and shows the card set information for each expansion below 
as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Child Card Sets and Expansions&#8221; is the reverse of 
&#8220;Show Expansions + Child Card Sets&#8221;, showing the child card sets and the 
expansion information below.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Parent Card Count&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>If the card set is the child of another card set, you can also display 
information about the parent card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Parent Count&#8221;, the default, will just show the count of the same 
card in the parent card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t show parent card counts&#8221; disables the column with the parent count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show difference between Parent Count and this card set&#8221; shows the difference 
between the parent count and the count for this card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use&#8221; shows the 
difference between the parent card set and total in all the <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> card 
set. If this card set is <strong>not</strong> <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>, then the number of cards in this 
set does not influence this number.</p>

<h2 id="filtering">Filtering</h2>

<p>Sutekh has a very powerful filtering model, which allows quite complex queries 
on the card database.</p>

<h3>The Basic filters</h3>

<p>There are a number of basic filters available for querying the card lists, 
such as <em>Clan</em>, <em>Discipline</em>, <em>&#8220;Card Text&#8221;</em> and so forth.</p>

<p>Most of these filters only allow a limited range of options which are 
selected from a drop down list. The <em>Clan</em> filter, 
for example, only accepts the clans listed in the database as input. Multiple 
items can be selected in this list, which means the filter matches on any of 
those selections.</p>

<p>Other filters, such as the <em>&#8220;Card Text&#8221;</em> filter, require you to enter a string. 
The filter will match any card that contains this string. The &#8217;%&#8217; character 
can be used as a wild card in this string to match any number of letters.</p>

<p>The <em>&#8220;Card Sets In Use&#8221;</em> filter takes no input.</p>

<p>The <em>&#8220;Card Count&#8221;</em> filter takes two selections. The first selects the card 
counts to match against, while the second is the card set to test against.</p>

<h3>Combing basic filters</h3>

<p>These basic filters can be combined to create more complex queries.</p>

<p>Multiple filters can be combined in 4 different ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>All of</li>
<li>Any of</li>
<li>Not All of</li>
<li>None of</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these allows multiple filters to be added to them, and then combine 
all the included filters according to the chosen rule.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;All of&#8221;</em> requires the all the included filters to be satisfied simultaneously. 
It useful for finding cards which require a discipline and a given cost, for 
example.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Any of&#8221;</em> requires that at least one of the included filters is satisfied.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Not All of&#8221;</em> requires that at least one of the included filters is not 
satisfied. The difference between <em>&#8220;Not All of</em>&#8221; and <em>&#8220;Any of&#8221;</em> is that _&#8220;Any 
of&#8220;_ will include the results of any cards that match all of the filters, while 
<em>&#8220;Not All of&#8221;</em> will exclude those, but return cards that satisfy none of the 
filters.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;None of&#8221;</em> requires that none of the included filters be satisfied.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic filters, the <strong>Sub-filter</strong> option allows these 
combinations to be nested. Thus an <em>&#8220;All of&#8221;</em> filter can include <em>&#8220;Any of&#8221;</em> or 
<em>&#8220;None of&#8221;</em> filters below it, which allows for extremely complex queries to 
be constructed.</p>

<p>For example, to find all cards that require either &#8216;Follower of Set&#8217; or 
&#8216;Serpentis&#8217;, but not both, the following filter could be constructed:</p>

<p>An <em>&#8220;Any of&#8221;</em> filter, which includes two <em>&#8220;All of&#8221;</em> sub-filters. Each 
sub-filter includes the <em>Clan</em> and <em>Discipline</em> basic filters, and the one is 
set to match &#8216;Followers of Set&#8217; and <span class="caps">NOT</span> &#8216;Serpentis&#8217; while the other is set to 
match <span class="caps">NOT</span> &#8216;Followers of Set&#8217; and &#8216;Serpentis&#8217;</p>

<p>Once a filter has been constructed, it can be saved with a given name and 
loaded again later.</p>

<h3>Filtering the Card Set List</h3>

<p>The card set list can also filtered. The basic filters available here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The card set name</li>
<li>The card set author</li>
<li>The card set comment</li>
<li>The name of the parent card set</li>
<li>Text in the annotations of the card set</li>
<li>Filter on all card sets marked in use</li>
</ul>

<p>These filters can be combined as well, allowing queries such as &#8216;All of 
card sets in use where the card set name includes &#8220;Nosferatu&#8221;&#8217;.</p>

<p>When filtering card sets, the card sets that match, <strong>and their parents</strong> are 
shown, since this relationship is always important.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Useful Tips</h2>

<h3>Entering card sets</h3>

<p>The different show card modes are often useful for entering a card set quickly. 
Start with with <em>&#8220;Show all cards&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Show cards in parent card set&#8221;</em> and 
then increment the cards that belong to the card set. Another useful approach 
is to use the <em>&#8220;Card Set from Filter&#8221;</em> option to create the card set.</p>

<p>When importing card sets from from other formats, the expansion information may 
be missing, in which case these cards will have no expansion set. In the case 
where this is a starter deck, for example, the _&#8220;Set selection to single 
expansion&#8220;_ option from the <em>Plugins</em> menu can be used to set all the cards to 
the correct expansion quickly.</p>
