<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are new to Sutekh, try reading <a href="Tutorial.html">The Sutekh Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Important Concepts</h2>

<p>Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: <em>Cards</em> and 
<em>Card Sets</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cards</em> are the individual cards as described by the official White Wolf 
card list. Each card describes all the relevant properties of the card, 
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest 
text for the card.</p>

<p>For each card, the expansion that specific card is from can be set. This 
allows one to distinguish between multiple copies of the same card from 
different expansions. If the expansion is not set, this is noted as 
<strong>Unknown Expansion</strong> in the card set view.</p>

<p><em>Card Sets</em> are collections of cards and describe the card and the number of 
copies of that card in the collection. An important concept is that card sets 
can be related in a parent-child hierarchy. A typical setup is to have a single 
card set for the main card collection (usually the <strong>My Collection</strong> card set), 
and other card sets, which represent the constructed decks, as children of this 
card set, but many other arrangements are possible.</p>

<h2 id="main">Main Window</h2>

<p>The main sutekh window can be split into a number of different panes.</p>

<p>The following panes are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ww">The White Wolf card list</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_set_list">The Card Set List</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_text">Card Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_image">Card Image</a></li>
<li><a href="#cardsets">Card Set</a> panes</li>
</ul>

<p>Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane. 
The main window has a menu for global actions.</p>

<p>Panes can be easily rearranged. Dragging a pane onto another pane will swap  
the two panes.</p>

<h3 id="main_file">File</h3>

<p>The file menu has the following options.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Import Card Set</em>: Import a card set from a existing file. The following 
file types are supported:
<ul>
<li><em>Load Card Set from File</em>: Loads a card set saved in Sutekh&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> file 
format.</li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSV</span></span> File</em>: <a href="#csv_plugin">Imports a card set from a comma-separated value 
file</a>, as produced by a spreadsheet. This allows the columns 
for card set, number and expansion to be selected. </li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ELDB</span></span> Card Set</em>: <a href="#import_plugin">Imports a file</a> 
saved by either <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FELDB</span></span>. Note that the correct type of file must be 
specified as well as the file name.</li>
<li><em>Import Card Sets from zip file</em>: Allows one to select <a href="#import_zip_plugin">card sets from a zip 
file</a> to import.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings</em>: Update the 
database with a new cardlist and/or rulings file. The files can either be 
local, or they can be downloaded from the White Wolf website directly. There 
may be issues when updating the card list after a new expansion has been 
published, discussed in the section 
&#8220;Refreshing the White Wolf Card List&#8221;#refresh</li>
<li><em>Download <span class="caps">VTES</span> icons</em>: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf 
website.</li>
<li><em>Preferences</em>: Manages various preferences.
<ul>
<li><em>Save Current Pane Set</em>: Saves the current configuration of the panes. </li>
<li><em>Save Pane Set on Exit</em>: Saves the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.</li>
<li><em>Save Exact Pane Positions</em>: Saves the exact pane positions on exit.</li>
<li><em>Save Window Size</em>: Save the window size on exit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Restore saved configuration</em>: Restores the panes to the saved configuration.</li>
<li><em>Quit</em>: Exit Sutekh</li>
</ul>

<p>When importing card sets, if Sutekh encounters an unknown card, the 
<a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Window</a> is used to identify them.</p>

<h3 id="main_pane_actions">Pane Actions</h3>

<p>This menu allows one to manage the panes in Sutekh.  The <em>Pane Actions</em> menu 
has the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Equalize pane sizes</em>: This rearranges the panes so that each pane has the 
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane horizontally</em>: This splits the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the 
active pane. The two panes are the same height as, and half the width of the 
pane being split.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane vertically</em>: This splits the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two 
panes are the same width as, and half the height of the pane being split. It is not 
possible to split panes vertically multiple times.</li>
<li><em>Add New Pane</em>: This adds a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of 
the main window. </li>
<li><em>Replace Pane</em>: This opens a submenu, where the currently active pane 
can be replaced with any of the available options.</li>
<li><em>Close Pane</em>: This closes the currently active pane</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main_plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The following plugins are available from the main menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#backup_plugin">Backup</a></li>
<li><a href="#images_plugin">Card Images</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:</p>

<p>One can cycle between different panes using the <strong>&lt;Tab&gt;</strong> key.</p>

<p>The currently active pane can be closed using the <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W</strong> shortcut.</p>

<p>For panes which support filtering, the filter editing dialog can be activated 
using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S</strong> (for specify filter), and the current filter can be 
toggled on and off by using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+</strong> and <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&#8212;</strong> shortcuts allow the entire tree displayed in a 
pane to either be fully expanded or completely collapsed.</p>

<h3 id="lookup">Card Lookup Window</h3>

<p>There are various reason why Sutekh my fail to correctly identify a card when 
importing a card set. Names vary (&#8220;Spirit&#8217;s Touch&#8221;, 
&#8220;The Spirit&#8217;s Touch&#8221;), special characters can be missing, and so forth. When 
this happens, Sutekh prompts for the correct card.</p>

<p>The card lookup window displays two lists &#8211; the list of all white wolf cards 
and the list of unknown cards. Below the unknown card list are options 
to specify a <a href="#filters">filter</a> and to apply or unapply the filter.</p>

<p>The unknown card list has 2 columns, the name of the unknown card and 
the current selection to replace the card, and 3 buttons. The first button 
uses the currently selected card from the full White Wolf card list to 
replace the card, the next marks the card as to be ignored, and the 
last applies a filter based on the unknown card name to present a 
list of reasonable options.</p>

<p>Once the replacement cards have been selected, the OK button will create the 
correct card set.</p>

<p>Choosing cancel in the card lookup dialog will abort the entire import, and 
no card set will be created.</p>

<p>If Sutekh cannot identify an expansion in the file, a dialog 
will prompt for the correct replacement. If an impossible card 
and expansion combination is found in the file, the same card lookup dialog 
will be used, except that the expansion as well as the card can be set.</p>

<h3 id="refresh">Refreshing the White Wolf Card List</h3>

<p>This allows Sutekh to update the card list to account for new cards, such 
as promos and such.</p>

<p>Since Sutekh parses the card list published on the white wolf site for 
information about the cards, when new expansions are published, Sutekh may 
require an update to correctly interpret any changes to the cardlist, such as 
new clans or card types. If the expansion does not introduce any significant 
changes, Sutekh is able to correctly import the new card list, but may 
not interpret the new expansion name correctly. If this happens, Sutekh should 
work fine, but, when updating to a new version of Sutekh, one may need to 
specify the correct mapping for the expansion when updating the database.</p>

<h2 id="ww">White Wolf Card List</h2>

<p>This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official 
white wolf card list.</p>

<h3 id="ww_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The Actions menu allows the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Show card expansions</em>: Toggles between showing the card expansions each 
card was printed in below the card name in the list.</li>
<li><em>Show icons for the grouping</em>: Toggles whether icons are shown for the top 
level grouping (when available) are not.</li>
<li><em>Expand All</em>: Expands all the items in the tree.</li>
<li><em>Collapse All</em>: Collapse the tree as far as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ww_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has three options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specify Filter</em>: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the  
<a href="#card_filters">Card Filters</a> section.</li>
<li><em>Apply Filter</em>: Toggle between whether the filter is currently applied to the 
list or not</li>
<li><em>Create Card Set From Filter</em>: Create a new card set containing the results 
of the current filter.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ww_plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The following plugins are available from the White Wolf Card List pane menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#cluster_plugin">Cluster Cards</a></li>
<li><a href="#stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</a></li>
<li><a href="#grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</a></li>
<li><a href="#columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="card_text">Card Text</h2>

<p>The Card Text Pane displays the text on the card, and any rulings that apply 
to the card.</p>

<p>This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card 
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the 
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups, 
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.</p>

<h2 id="card_image">Card Images</h2>

<p>If the <a href="#images_plugin">Card Image Plugin</a> has been configured, this pane 
will display the appropriate card image for each pane. By default, the 
image is resized to fit the pane. By right clicking on the image, this can be changed. 
The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fit images to the pane</em>: This is the default</li>
<li><em>Show images at fixed size</em>: All the images are shown as 225&#215;300 in size.</li>
<li><em>Show images at original size</em>: All the image are shown at the original size 
of the scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are multiple images for the given card form the different expansions, 
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card. 
It&#8217;s possible to cycle through the available expansions by either left clicking 
on the image, or using the <em>Show next expansion image</em> and _Show previous 
expansion image_ options when right clicking on the frame.</p>

<h2 id="csv_plugin">Import <span class="caps">CSV</span> file</h2>

<p>This allows importing card sets stored as a comma-separated file, commonly 
produced by spreadsheets. The file must contain a column with card names, 
and a column with the card counts, and can optionally contain a column with 
the expansions. When importing the file, the mapping between columns and the 
contents needs to be specified.</p>

<p>If Sutekh cannot correctly interpret a name or expansion, the  
<a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Window</a> will be used to resolve the situation.</p>

<h2 id="import_plugin">Import <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">ELDB</span> file</h2>

<p>This allows one to import files produced by <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">FELDB</span>. The file format 
is not automatically recognised, so it needs to be manually specified.</p>

<p>For some types of file, such as <span class="caps">ARDB</span> inventories, the card set name for the 
imported file will need to be specified manually.</p>

<p>If the name of the card set clashes with an existing name, one will 
be asked to rename the imported card set or cancel the import.</p>

<p>If no cards are found in the card set, the card set will not be created.</p>

<h2 id="import_zip_plugin">Import card sets from zip file</h2>

<p>This plugin allows one to select some of the Sutekh Card Sets included 
in a zip file (such as those produced by the backup plugin) and import them 
into the card set. Unlike the backup plugin, this does not replace any of 
the existing card sets.</p>

<p>After selecting the zip file, one will be asked to select the card sets to 
import from the list of card sets in the zip file. If any of the card sets 
share the same name as an existing card set, one will be asked to either 
rename the card set, or skip importing that card set.</p>

<p>For card sets with parents, if the appropriate parent card set can&#8217;t be found, 
the card set will be imported with no parent set.</p>

<h2 id="card_set_list">Card Set List</h2>

<p>This pane lists all the card sets defined. The card sets are arranged so that 
child card sets are listed below their parents.</p>

<p>Card sets can be opened by either double clicking on them, or dragging the card 
set name to an existing pane.</p>

<p>The parent of the card set can be changed by dragging the card set name onto 
the new parent.</p>

<p>Sets can either be marked as <em>in use</em> or <em>not in use</em>. This is intended to 
help track which cards are currently available for use in new card sets.</p>

<h3 id="card_set_list_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The following actions are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Create New Card Set</em>: Creates a new card set.</li>
<li><em>Edit Card Set Properties</em>: This allows the card set name, author &amp; comment 
to be changed, allows the parent of the card set to be changed, and allows 
annotations to be added to the card set.</li>
<li><em>Mark/Unmark Card Set as In Use</em>: Toggles the card set between <em>in use</em> 
and <em>not in use</em>.</li>
<li><em>Delete Card Set</em>: Deletes the currently selected card set.</li>
<li><em>Expand All</em>: Expands all the items in the tree.</li>
<li><em>Collapse All</em>: Collapse the tree as far as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card_set_list_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specify Filter</em>: Specify the filter to apply to the card set list. See the  
<a href="#card_set_filters">Card Set Filters</a> section.</li>
<li><em>Apply Filter</em>: Toggle between whether the filter is currently applied to the 
list or not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cardsets">Card Sets</h2>

<h3 id="cardsets_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The Actions menu allows the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Edit Card Set Properties</em>: This allows the card set name, author &amp; comment 
to be changed, allows the parent of the card set to be changed, and allows 
annotations to be added to the card set.</li>
<li><em>Save Card Set to File</em>: This allows the card set to be saved to Sutekh&#8217;s

This option is only available when the card set is editable.</li>
<li><em>Delete selection</em>: This deletes the selected cards from the card set. This 
is only possible when the card set is editable.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the card set is not editable, changes cannot be made to the contents 
directly. It is still possible to change the card set contents by 
editing the parent card set when the <em>Display Mode</em> -> <em>Show Child Card Sets</em> 
option is active.</p>

<h3 id="cardsets_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has three options:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="#opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</a></li>
<li><a href="#prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</a> 
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cardsets_keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist.</p>

<p>The editable state of the card set can be toggled using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E</strong>.</p>

<p>The current selection can be copied to the clipboard using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C</strong></p>

<p>If the card set is editable, the current selection can be deleted using <strong>&lt;Del&gt;</strong> 
or pasted into the card set using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V</strong></p>

<p>For an editable card set, the card number for the entire selection can be set 
in the range 1 to 9 directly by entering the number directly, or all the number 
for all cards in the selection can either be incremented or decremented by 
1 using either <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> respectively. If the card set is not editable, these 
keys have no effect.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Filtering is one of the central activities in Sutekh. Complex queries can 
be constructed by <a href="#combining">combining</a> the various basic filters.</p>

<p>The Filter dialog will display the last used filter for the given pane. This 
filter can then be modified or the filter can be cleared using the 
<em>Clear Filter</em> button.</p>

<p>Complex filters can be saved for later reuse using the <em>Save</em> button, and 
recalled using the <em>Load</em> button. When modifying a filter, it can be reverted 
to the saved version using the <em>Revert Filter</em> button.</p>

<h3 id="card_filters">Card Filters</h3>

<p>These filters apply to either the white wolf card list or a card set. The 
following basic filters are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Card Type</em>: Filters on the type of card. This takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of 
card types.</li>
<li><em>Cost Type</em>: Filters on the type of cost (blood, pool, and so forth). This 
takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of cost types.  This does not consider the cost, just the 
cost type.</li>
<li><em>Clan</em>: filter on the clan(s) associated with the card. This takes a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of clans and the filter matches if the clan matches any clan 
in the list.</li>
<li><em>Discipline</em>: Filter on the discipline associated with the card. This takes 
a <a href="#list">list</a> of disciplines, and the filter matches if any of the 
disciplines in the list match. This filter ignores the level requirement for 
the discipline.</li>
<li><em>Group</em>: Filter on the group listed on the card. This takes a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of groups, and matches the group listed on the card to this list.</li>
<li><em>Capacity</em>: Filter on the capacity listed on the card. This takes a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of capacities, and matches the capacity listed on the card to 
this list.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Filter on the cost of the card. This filter takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of 
costs to match, and matches the numerical card cost to this list. Note that 
this does not consider the cost type. To filter only on costs of a specific 
type, this needs to be combined with the <em>Cost Type</em> filter.</li>
<li><em>Life (Crypt)</em>: Filter on the life cost of the crypt card. This takes a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of values, and matches the life listed on the card to this list. 
Note that this only matches the life associated with crypt cards (currently the 
Imbued), and doesn&#8217;t match the life for other allies or retainers.</li>
<li><em>Creed</em>: Filter on the creed associated with the card. Like the <em>Clan</em> 
filter, this takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of creeds to match.</li>
<li><em>Virtue</em>: Filter on the virtues associated with the card. Like the <em>Discipline</em> 
filter, this takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of virtues to match.</li>
<li><em>Card Text</em>: Filter on the text of the card. This filter takes a 
<a href="#string">string</a> to match against.</li>
<li><em>Card Name</em>: Filter on the name of the card. This filter takes a 
<a href="#string">string</a>.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Matches against the sect of the vampire. This filter takes a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of sects to match against.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Filter on the title of the vampire. This filter takes a <a href="#list">list</a> 
of titles and matches the card title to this list.</li>
<li><em>Expansion_with_Rarity</em>: Filter on the expansion and rarity of the card. This 
filter takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of expansion with rarities, and matches a card if 
it was printed with the given expansion and rarity combinations. Note 
that this filter matches the list of expansions a card has been printed in, and 
ignores the expansion information set for a card. If one wants to filter on 
the card&#8217;s expansion information, use the <em>Physical Expansion</em> filter.</li>
<li><em>Discipline with Level</em>: Filter on the discipline associated with the card. 
This takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of disciplines of the different levels, and the 
filter matches if the card matches the disciplines in the list.  This filter 
treats the different levels of the filter as different. This filter is most 
useful for matching vampires. Note that non-vampire cards are matched only 
by the superior discipline. 
inferior.</li>
<li><em>Physical Expansion</em>: This filter matches on the expansion information 
set for a card. This filter takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of expansions, and matches 
the expansion set for the card to this list. This is different from the 
<em>Expansion_with_Rarity</em> filter since it ignores rarities, and matches the 
expansion set for the card, not the list of expansions the card was printed 
in.</li>
<li><em>Card Sets</em>: The filter matches cards that belong to the given <a href="#list">list</a> 
of other card sets.</li>
<li><em>In Card Sets In Use</em>: This matches the cards against the child card sets 
marked as in use. A card matches if it belongs to a card set in use. This 
filter has no parameters.</li>
<li><em>Card Count</em>: This matches the card against a count in either the same 
card set or a different card set. It takes a <a href="#list">list</a> of card counts, 
and a single card set to match against, and matches those cards that 
satisfy these conditions.</li>
<li><em>Card Function</em>: This filter matches the card against a <a href="#list">list</a> of 
common card functions. </li>
<li><em>Sub-Filter</em>: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See 
<a href="#combining">Combining Basic Filters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These filters are also available in the <a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Window</a> when 
importing card sets, to help find unknown cards.</p>

<p>Currently, the only way to filter on properties of a merged vampire, such as 
different discipline levels, is to filter on the card text.</p>

<h3 id="card_set_filters">Card Set Filters</h3>

<p>These filters apply to the card set list. The following basic filters are 
supported.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Card Set Name</em>: This matches the name of the card set. Like the Card Name 
or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial <a href="#string">string</a> to search for. 
% and _ can be used as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Description</em>: This matches the description of the card set. 
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial 
<a href="#string">string</a> to search for.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Author</em>: This matches the description of the card set. 
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial 
<a href="#string">string</a> to search for.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Annotations</em>: This matches the annotations of the card set. 
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial 
<a href="#string">string</a> to search for.</li>
<li><em>Parent Card Set</em>: This takes as input a <a href="#list">list</a> of card sets, and 
matches those card sets whose parent card set is in the list.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Marked as in Use</em>: This matches all card sets which are marked 
as being <strong>In Use</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Sub-Filter</em>: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See 
<a href="#combining">Combining Basic Filters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Since the card sets can be part of a hierarchy of parents and children, if a 
child card set matches the filter, it will be displayed along with it&#8217;s  
parents. If a parent card set matches the filter, only those children that 
also match the filter will be displayed.</p>

<h3 id="combining">Combining Basic Filters</h3>

<p>Sutekh combines filters using filter boxes to group the basic filters 
together.</p>

<p>There are 4 types of filter box, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>All of</em>: This filter matches only if every filter in the box matches.</li>
<li><em>Any of</em>: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box matches.</li>
<li><em>Not all of</em>: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box 
doesn&#8217;t match. </li>
<li><em>Not any of</em>: This filter matches only if every filter in the box doesn&#8217;t 
match.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each filter boxes can also contain sub-filters, which are themselves 
filter boxes. Thus complex queries can be constructed by nesting multiple 
filter boxes.</p>

<h3 id="string">String filters</h3>

<p>Several filters use a user specified string to match on. These filter matches 
if this string is contained in the property filtered on, so a Card Name 
filter, if the given string is a substring of the card name.</p>

<p>String filters are also case insensitive (so <strong>the</strong> will match both *Weigh the 
Heart* and <strong>Yuri, The Talon</strong>, when filtering on the card name, for example).</p>

<p>In Addition, filters which take a string as input can use two different 
wildcard characters.</p>

<p><strong>_</strong> will match any single letter. Thus a filter using <strong>a_c</strong> will match 
both <strong>abc</strong> and <strong>aec</strong>, but not match <strong>abdc</strong> or <strong>abd</strong>. <strong>_</strong> will never match 
the empty string, so <strong>Th_e</strong> will not match <strong>The</strong>, but will match <strong>Thee</strong></p>

<p><strong>%</strong> will match any selection of characters. So <strong>a%c</strong> will match any of 
<strong>abc</strong>, <strong>aec</strong>, or <strong>abdegfthc</strong>, but not match <strong>abdefg</strong>. <strong>%</strong> will also match 
the empty string, so <strong>Th%e</strong> will match both <strong>The</strong> and <strong>Three</strong>.</p>

<p>Wildcards can be used multiple times. So <strong>a_b%e</strong> will match any of 
<strong>acbde</strong>, <strong>aebe</strong> or <strong>aebfe</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="list">List filters</h3>

<p>Several filters accept a list of possible options to match against.</p>

<p>The filter is considered to match if any of the entries in this list 
are matched. Thus a <em>Clan</em> filter, specifying both <strong>Tremere</strong> and <strong>Toreador</strong>, 
will be matched by cards requiring/of either of the clans.</p>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugin List</h2>

<h3 id="backup_plugin">Backup</h3>

<p>This allows one to either save or restore a full backup of the current 
database. The backup will be saved as a zip file and is independent of the 
database back-end Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used to 
transfer the complete state between different databases.</p>

<p>There are two options offered by the plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Save a Full Backup</em></li>
<li><em>Restore a Full Backup</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Save a Full Backup</em> will save the current state (card sets and their contents) 
to the specified zip file. <em>Restore a Full Backup</em> will import all the card sets 
from the backup. Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently 
in the database with the contents of the backup.</p>

<p>Backups can be saved at any time. Various actions, such as updating the White 
Wolf card list, will also allow a backup to be saved.</p>

<h3 id="images_plugin">Card Images</h3>

<p>This plugin allows configuring the card images pane.</p>

<p>The image can be configured in three ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Download and install cardimages from feldb.extra.hu</em>: This attempts to 
download the images form the <span class="caps">FELDB</span> website, and makes them available to 
Sutekh. The zip file is quite large, so this option may take some time.</li>
<li><em>Install images from a local zip file</em>: If a zip file containing the 
images is available, Sutekh can install directly from this zipfile.</li>
<li><em>Choose a directory containing the images</em>: If the images have already been 
installed for some other reason (such as an existing <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">FELDB</span> 
installation), then this option can be used to configure Sutekh to reuse that 
installation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cluster_plugin">Cluster Cards</h3>

<p>The clustering plugin attempts to group cards from a card list into sets 
(clusters) of cards with similar properties. The intention is to provide a way 
to explore subsets of one&#8217;s cards and perhaps to look for groups of cards which 
might provide starting points for deck construction. Currently running the 
clustering tool is quite slow, so be patient when waiting for large card lists 
to be grouped (it will finish eventually).</p>

<p>Upon opening the clustering plugin, three tabs are presented&#8212; 
<em>Select Columns</em>, <em>Settings</em> and <em>Results</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Select Columns</em> tab is where one selects the properties to consider when 
grouping the cards. Properties are organised into categories for ease of 
selection. If unsure on which properties to select, start by selecting the 
disciplines and clans you&#8217;re most interested in.</p>

<p>Under the <em>Settings</em> tab, one can tweak the clustering algorithm parameters. 
The plugin implements K-means clustering using K-means++ to determine the 
initial cluster centers followed by Lloyd&#8217;s method of iteratively refining the 
clusters. Three parameters can be set:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Number of iterations</em>: Number of Lloyd refinement steps to perform. More 
steps makes the clustering take longer but fewer steps may result in a less 
optimal grouping. Ten steps should be sufficient for most cases.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Number of clusters</em>: By default the plugin creates one cluster per 80 cards 
(this being the size of a deck) but the number of clusters may also be set 
manually.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Distance measure</em>: Two distance metrics are currently supported. The 
Euclidean distance setting clusters using the usual N-dimensional vector space 
metric. The Sutekh distance metric modifies the Euclidean one to make property 
values of -1 (used internally by Sutekh to mark costs of X and the <span class="caps">ANY</span> crypt 
group) close to all others and values of zero slightly further away than usual. 
If in doubt, leave the metric set to the Sutekh distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the property columns have been selected and the parameters set, use the 
<em>Execute</em> button to begin the clustering. When clustering is complete, the 
<em>Results</em> tab will be populated.</p>

<p>The results are presented as a table. Each row corresponds to a cluster of 
cards. The first column contains checkboxes. Use these to select which clusters 
to create cards sets from before clicking the 
<em>Make Cards Sets from Selected Clusters</em> button at the bottom of the results. 
The second column contains the cluster number, which enables one to determine 
which cluster the card sets created correspond to.  The third column shows how 
many cards are present in each cluster and the last lists the property 
values of the cluster center (property values of zero are omitted).</p>

<h3 id="stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</h3>

<p>This plugin shows an analysis of all the difference clans in the White Wolf 
card list. For each clan, the number of vampires in each clan, the sum of the 
vampire capacities and the most common disciplines are shown. The  
score for the discipline, and various stats about how the disciplines are 
distributed are also shown.</p>

<p>The tree view can be expanded to show the details for each legal grouping 
combination.</p>

<p>The score is intended to give some indication of how common 
disciplines are. Vampires without the discipline score 0 for that 
discipline, vampires with the inferior discipline score 1 and vampires 
with the superior discipline score 2.</p>

<h3 id="grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</h3>

<p>By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types. The grouping 
used can be changed via this menu option.</p>

<p>The following groupings are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds</em>: Group cards by the either clan or the creed associated 
with the card. This treats the Imbued Creeds as if they were Vampire Clans.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues</em>: Group cards by the either the disciplines or the 
virtues on the card. This treats the Imbued Virtues as if they were Vampire 
Disciplines.</li>
<li><em>Crypt or Library</em>: Split the card list into crypt and library cards</li>
<li><em>Card Type</em>: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping 
treats multi-type cards, such as <em>&#8220;Action Modifier/Combat&#8221;</em> cards as belonging 
to both the <em>&#8220;Action Modifier&#8221;</em> and the <em>&#8220;Combat&#8221;</em> groups.</li>
<li><em>Expansion</em>: Group by the expansions the cards have been printed in</li>
<li><em>Rarity</em>: Group the cards by the published rarity.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Group cards by the Sect associated with the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Group cards by the political title on the card.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Group cards by the cost on the card.</li>
<li><em>Multi Card Type</em>: Like the <em>Card Type</em> grouping, except this treats 
multi-type cards as separate types. Thus <em>&#8220;Action Modifier/Combat&#8221;</em> will 
appear as a separate group, and the cards will not be listed in either the 
<em>&#8220;Action Modifier&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Combat&#8221;</em> groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</h3>

<p>By default, sutekh only shows the card name in the White Wolf Card List, 
and the number and card name for the card set lists. Additional columns 
to display can be selected using this plugin. The extra columns are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds:</em> Also display the clans or creeds associated with the 
card.</li>
<li><em>Group:</em> Show the group number for the card.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues:</em> Show the Disciplines and Virtues associated with 
the card.</li>
<li><em>Card Type:</em> Also show the card type.</li>
<li><em>Expansions:</em> Show the expansions this card has been printed in.</li>
<li><em>Capacity or Life(Imbued):</em> Show the capacity associated with this card, or 
the life for the Imbued crypt cards. Ally &amp; retainer life is not shown.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Show the Sect associated with the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Show the political title possessed by the vampire card.</li>
<li><em>Card Text</em>: Show the text printed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Show the cost of the card.</li>
</ul>

<p>The display can be sorted according to a column, by clicking on the  
column header. When cards have equal values, they are sorted by the card name. 
Because the different cost types aren&#8217;t comparable, the 
cost column groups each distinct cost type together and sorts within the 
cost types.</p>

<p>If the icons have been downloaded from the white wolf site, then for the 
appropriate columns, the display can be toggled between the 
<em>Show Icons and Names</em>, <em>Show Text only</em> and <em>Show Icons only</em> using the radio 
buttons. This option will affect all the selected columns that can use icons.</p>

<h3 id="set_exp_plugin">Set selected cards to a single expansion</h3>

<p>This searches for the common expansions between all the selected cards, and 
allows the user to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all 
the selected cards is set to this common choice.</p>

<h3 id="compare_plugin">Compare card set with another Card Set</h3>

<p>This plugin compares the current card set to a different card set, and displays 
which cards are common to the card sets, and, for each card set, lists the 
unique cards.</p>

<p>By default, the plugin ignores the expansions of cards, and considers all 
cards of the same name as the same, but this behaviour can be changed using the 
<em>Consider Expansions as well</em> checkbox when selecting the card set to compare 
to.</p>

<h3 id="analyze_plugin">Analyze Deck</h3>

<p>This plugin examines a card set and displays various statistics about it that 
are intended to give some indication of how the card set will operate as a 
deck.</p>

<p>Several tabs are displayed, where each tab summarises different aspects 
of the card set. The first tab summarises some basic information about the 
entire set. The second tab implements Legbiter&#8217;s Happy Family analysis for 
the card set. Subsequent panes consider specific card types.</p>

<p>The happy family implementation allows one to either select the number of 
disciplines to use, or to select the disciplines to consider manually.</p>

<h3 id="indep_plugin">Test Card Set Independence</h3>

<p>This tests the current card set against other card sets with the same parent, 
and considers whether there are enough cards in the parent card set to 
simultaneously construct all the selected sets. Multiple decks can be selected 
from the list of card sets.</p>

<p>The current card set can be tested against all the sets with the same 
parent marked as in use using the <em>Test against all card sets marked as in use</em> 
check box when selecting decks to compare against. This check box overrides 
any selected entries from the list.</p>

<p>The results list all the cards missing from the parent card set, and, for 
each set which includes the missing cards, the cards for that set are listed.</p>

<h3 id="opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</h3>

<p>This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the 
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended 
to give some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition, 
the plugin can generate example opening hands and crypts via the _Draw sample 
hand_ button.</p>

<h3 id="prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</h3>

<p>This plugin displays the probability of drawing the selected cards from either 
the library or the crypt. Unlike the <em>simulate opening hand</em> plugin, this 
plugin displays results for longer sequences of drawing cards.</p>

<p>The plugin has the following settings which can be used to change the results.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>columns in table</em>: This sets the number of draws shown in the table and can 
range from 1 to 8. The first column is always the probably for the opening hand 
or crypt draw. Subsequent columns are the total probability after also drawing 
the number of extra cards shown in the column header.</li>
<li><em>step between columns</em>: This sets the number of cards drawn between columns 
and ranges from 1 to 10 (defaulting to 1). Each subsequent column after the 
first of the table shows the probabilities after drawing this number of 
additional cards.</li>
<li><em>cards of interest</em>: This sets the number of rows in the table, and can 
range from 1 to the total number of cards selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The selected changes are only applied when the <em>recalculate table</em> button is 
pressed.</p>

<h3 id="rulebook_plugin">Rulebook</h3>

<p>This plugin allows downloading copies of the rulebook, imbued rules and card 
rulings from the White Wolf site or installing previously downloaded copies. 
Once downloaded, the rulebook files may be opened in a web browser using the 
<em>Rulebook</em> submenu in the <em>Plugins</em> menu on the <em>Main Window</em>. To 
download the files, or update the existing copies, use the 
<em>Configure Rulebook Plugin</em> item in the same submenu.</p>
