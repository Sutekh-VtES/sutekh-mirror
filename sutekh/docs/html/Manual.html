<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are new to Sutekh, try reading <a href="Tutorial.html">The Sutekh Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Important Concepts</h2>

<p>Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: <em>Cards</em> and 
<em>Card Sets</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cards</em> are the individual cards as described by the official White Wolf 
card list. Sutekh describes all the relevant properties of each card, 
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest 
card text.</p>

<p>You can set the expansion to which each specific card belongs. This 
allows you to distinguish between multiple copies of the same card from 
different expansions. If the expansion is not set, Sutekh notes this as 
<strong>Unknown Expansion</strong> in the card set view.</p>

<p><em>Card Sets</em> are collections of cards, and describe each card and the number of 
copies of that card in the collection. Card sets can be related in a 
parent-child hierarchy. In a typical setup, there is a single card set for the 
main card collection (usually the <strong>My Collection</strong> card set); and other card 
sets, which represent constructed decks, are children of this card set&#8212;but 
many other arrangements are possible.</p>

<h2 id="main">Main Window</h2>

<p>You can split the main Sutekh window into a number of different panes.</p>

<p>The following panes are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ww">The White Wolf card list</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_set_list">The Card Set List</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_text">Card Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_image">Card Image</a></li>
<li><a href="#cardsets">Card Set</a> panes</li>
</ul>

<p>Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane. 
The main window has a menu for global actions.</p>

<p>You can easily rearrange panes. You can swap two panes by dragging one onto the 
other.</p>

<h3 id="main_file">File</h3>

<p>The file menu has the following options.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Import Card Set</em>: Import a card set from a existing file. The following 
file types are supported:
<ul>
<li><em>Load Card Set from File</em>: Load a card set saved in Sutekh&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> file 
format.</li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSV</span></span> File</em>: <a href="#csv_plugin">Import a card set from a comma-separated value 
file</a>, as produced by a spreadsheet. You can select the columns 
for card set, number and expansion.</li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ELDB</span></span> Card Set</em>: <a href="#import_plugin">Import a file</a> 
saved by either <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FELDB</span></span>. You must specify the correct type of file as well 
as the file name.</li>
<li><em>Import Card Sets from zip file</em>: Select <a href="#import_zip_plugin">card sets from a zip 
file</a> to import.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings</em>: Update the 
database with a new cardlist and/or rulings file. You can either specify local 
files, or opt to download them from the White Wolf website directly. Sutekh may 
encounter problems when updating the card list after a new expansion has been 
published&#8212;this is discussed further in the section 
&#8220;Refreshing the White Wolf Card List&#8221;#refresh.</li>
<li><em>Download <span class="caps">VTES</span> icons</em>: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf 
website.</li>
<li><em>Preferences</em>: Manage various preferences.
<ul>
<li><em>Save Current Pane Set</em>: Save the current configuration of the panes.</li>
<li><em>Save Pane Set on Exit</em>: Save the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.</li>
<li><em>Save Exact Pane Positions</em>: Save the exact pane positions on exit.</li>
<li><em>Save Window Size</em>: Save the window size on exit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Restore saved configuration</em>: Restore the panes to the saved configuration.</li>
<li><em>Quit</em>: Exit Sutekh.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Sutekh encounters an unknown card when importing card sets, it will prompt 
you to identify it using the <a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Dialog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="main_pane_actions">Pane Actions</h3>

<p>This menu allows you to manage the panes in Sutekh. The <em>Pane Actions</em> menu 
has the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Equalize pane sizes</em>: Rearrange the panes so that each pane has the 
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane horizontally</em>: Split the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the 
active pane. The two panes will be the same height as, and half the width of the 
pane being split.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane vertically</em>: Split the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two 
panes will be the same width as, and half the height of the pane being split. It 
is not possible to split panes vertically multiple times.</li>
<li><em>Add New Pane</em>: Add a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of 
the main window.</li>
<li><em>Replace Pane</em>: Replace the currently active pane with another. The available 
options will be presented in a submenu.</li>
<li><em>Close Pane</em>: Close the currently active pane.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main_plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The following plugins are available from the main menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#backup_plugin">Backup</a></li>
<li><a href="#images_plugin">Card Images</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:</p>

<p>You can cycle between different panes using the <strong>&lt;Tab&gt;</strong> key.</p>

<p>You can close the currently active pane using the <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W</strong> shortcut.</p>

<p>In panes which support filtering, you can activate the filter editing dialog 
using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S</strong> (for &#8221;*S*pecify filter&#8221;), and toggle the current filter 
on and off using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+</strong> and <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&#8212;</strong> shortcuts allow you to expand fully or 
collapse completely the entire tree displayed in a pane.</p>

<h3 id="lookup">Card Lookup Dialog</h3>

<p>For various reasons, Sutekh may fail to identify a card correctly when 
importing a card set. Names vary (&#8220;Spirit&#8217;s Touch&#8221;, 
&#8220;The Spirit&#8217;s Touch&#8221;), special characters can be missing, etc.. When 
this happens, Sutekh will prompt you for the correct card.</p>

<p>The card lookup window displays two lists: the list of all White Wolf cards 
and the list of unknown cards. Below the unknown card list are options 
to specify a <a href="#filters">filter</a> and to apply or unapply the filter.</p>

<p>The unknown card list has two columns&#8212;the name of the unknown card and 
the currently selected replacement from the White Wolf card list&#8212;and three 
buttons. Use the first button to replace the card with the currently selected 
card, the second button to mark the card as ignored, and the last to view a list 
of reasonable options (Sutekh finds these by applying a filter based on the 
unknown card name).</p>

<p>Once you have selected replacements for all unknown cards (or chosen to ignore 
them), use the OK button to create the card set.</p>

<p>If you choose to cancel, the entire import will be aborted and no card set will 
be created.</p>

<p>If Sutekh cannot identify an expansion in the file, it will prompt you for the 
correct replacement. If Sutekh finds an impossible card and expansion 
combination, it will prompt you to resolve the situation using the card lookup 
dialog&#8212;but you will have the opportunity to select both the card and the 
expansion.</p>

<h3 id="refresh">Refreshing the White Wolf Card List</h3>

<p>This allows Sutekh to update the card list to account for new cards, such 
as promos.</p>

<p>Sutekh parses the card list published on the White Wolf site for 
information about the cards. When new expansions are published, Sutekh may 
require an update to interpret major changes to the cardlist, such as 
new clans or card types. If the expansion does not introduce any significant 
changes, Sutekh may be able to import the new card list correctly, but may be 
unable to interpret the new expansion name. If this happens, Sutekh should 
continue working, but you may need to specify the correct mapping for the 
expansion when updating the database during your next upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="ww">White Wolf Card List</h2>

<p>This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official 
White Wolf card list.</p>

<h3 id="ww_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The Actions menu allows the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Show card expansions</em>: Toggle display of the card expansions in which each 
card was printed below the card name in the list.</li>
<li><em>Show icons for the grouping</em>: Toggle whether icons are shown for the top 
level grouping (when available).</li>
<li><em>Expand All</em>: Expand all the items in the tree.</li>
<li><em>Collapse All</em>: Collapse the tree as far as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ww_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has three options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specify Filter</em>: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the 
<a href="#card_filters">Card Filters</a> section.</li>
<li><em>Apply Filter</em>: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the 
list.</li>
<li><em>Create Card Set From Filter</em>: Create a new card set containing the results 
of the current filter.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ww_plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The following plugins are available from the White Wolf Card List pane menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#cluster_plugin">Cluster Cards</a></li>
<li><a href="#stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</a></li>
<li><a href="#grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</a></li>
<li><a href="#columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="card_text">Card Text</h2>

<p>The Card Text Pane displays the text on the card, and any rulings that apply 
to the card.</p>

<p>This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card 
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the 
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups, 
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.</p>

<h2 id="card_image">Card Images</h2>

<p>If the <a href="#images_plugin">Card Image Plugin</a> has been configured, this pane 
will display the appropriate card image for each pane. By default, all images 
are resized to fit the pane. You can change this setting by right-clicking on 
the image.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fit images to the pane</em>: All images are resized to fit the pane.</li>
<li><em>Show images at fixed size</em>: All images are resized to 225&#215;300 pixels.</li>
<li><em>Show images at original size</em>: All images are shown at the original size 
of the scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are multiple images for the given card from the different expansions, 
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card. 
You can cycle through the available expansions either by left-clicking 
on the image, or by selecting the <em>Show next expansion image</em> and 
<em>Show previous expansion image</em> options after right-clicking on the frame.</p>

<h2 id="csv_plugin">Import <span class="caps">CSV</span> file</h2>

<p>This allows you to import card sets stored as a comma-separated file, a format 
commonly produced by spreadsheets. The file must contain a column with card 
names and a column with card counts, and can optionally contain a column with 
expansions. When you importing the file, you must specify the mapping between 
the columns and their contents.</p>

<p>If Sutekh cannot correctly interpret a name or expansion, it will prompt you to 
resolve the situation using the <a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Dialog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="import_plugin">Import <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">ELDB</span> file</h2>

<p>This allows you to import files produced by <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">FELDB</span>. Sutekh does not 
recognise the file format automatically, so you must specify it manually.</p>

<p>For some types of file, such as <span class="caps">ARDB</span> inventories, you will also need to specify 
a card set name for the imported file.</p>

<p>If the name of the card set clashes with an existing name, you will 
be asked to rename the imported card set or cancel the import.</p>

<p>If no cards are found in the card set, the card set will not be created.</p>

<h2 id="import_zip_plugin">Import card sets from zip file</h2>

<p>This plugin allows you to select some or all of the Sutekh Card Sets included 
in a zip file (such as those produced by the backup plugin) and import them 
into the card set. Unlike the backup plugin, this does not replace any existing 
card sets.</p>

<p>After selecting the zip file, you will be asked to select the card sets to 
import from the list of card sets in the zip file. If any of the card sets share 
the same name as an existing card set, you will be asked either to rename the 
card set, or skip importing that card set.</p>

<p>If a card set to be imported has a parent card set, and that set cannot be 
found, the card set will be imported with no parent set.</p>

<h2 id="card_set_list">Card Set List</h2>

<p>This pane lists all the card sets which have been defined. The card sets are 
arranged so that child card sets are listed below their parents.</p>

<p>You can open a card set either by double-clicking on its name, or by dragging 
the name to an existing pane.</p>

<p>You can change the parent of a card set by dragging the card set name onto the 
new parent&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>You can mark sets either as <em>in use</em> or <em>not in use</em>. This is intended to 
help you track which cards are currently available for you to use in new card 
sets.</p>

<h3 id="card_set_list_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The following actions are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Create New Card Set</em>: Create a new card set.</li>
<li><em>Edit Card Set Properties</em>: Change the card set name, author and comment,

<li><em>Delete Card Set</em>: Delete the currently selected card set.</li>
<li><em>Expand All</em>: Expand all the items in the tree.</li>
<li><em>Collapse All</em>: Collapse the tree as far as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="card_set_list_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specify Filter</em>: Specify the filter to apply to the card set list. See the 
<a href="#card_set_filters">Card Set Filters</a> section.</li>
<li><em>Apply Filter</em>: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the 
list.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cardsets">Card Sets</h2>

<li><em>Delete selection</em>: Delete the selected cards from the card set. This 
is only possible when the card set is editable. The deleted selection is not 
placed in the buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the card set is not editable, you cannot make changes to its contents 
directly. It is still possible for you to change the card set contents by 
editing the parent card set when the <em>Display Mode</em> -> <em>Show Child Card Sets</em> 
option is active.</p>

<h3 id="cardsets_filter">Filter</h3>

<p>The filter menu has three options:</p>

<li><a href="#opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</a></li>
<li><a href="#prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cardsets_keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist:</p>

<p>You can toggle the editable state of the card set using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E</strong>.</p>

<p>You can copy the current selection to the clipboard using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C</strong>.</p>

<p>If the card set is editable, you can delete the current selection using 
<strong>&lt;Del&gt;</strong> or paste a copied selection into the card set using 
<strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V</strong>.</p>

<p>In an editable card set, you can set the count for all the cards in a selection 
to a number from one to ten by typing the number directly. You can increment 
and decrement the count for all the cards in a selection using <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong>. If 
the card set is not editable, these keys have no effect.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Filtering is one of the most common activities in Sutekh. You can construct 
complex queries by <a href="#combining">combining</a> various basic filters.</p>

<p>The Filter dialog will display the last used filter for the given pane. You can 
clear or modify this filter using the <em>Clear Filter</em> button.</p>

<p>You can save complex filters for later reuse using the <em>Save</em> button, and recall 
them using the <em>Load</em> button. When modifying a filter, you can revert to the 
saved version using the <em>Revert Filter</em> button.</p>

<h3 id="card_filters">Card Filters</h3>

<p>These filters apply either to the White Wolf card list or a card set. The 
following basic filters are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Card Type</em>: Filter on the type of card. You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of 
card types. A card matches if any one of its types matches any type in the 
list.</li>
<li><em>Cost Type</em>: Filter on the type of cost which must be paid for the card. You 
must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of cost types. The filter ignores the numerical 
cost, and considers only the cost type. If you wish to filter on a specific 
cost and cost type, you must combine this filter with the <em>Cost</em> filter. 
Presently, the recognised types of cost are pool, blood and conviction, and this 
filter matches only library cards. Vampire capacity and ally/retainer life are 
not considered to be cost types.</li>
<li><em>Clan</em>: Filter on the clan(s) listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of clans. A card matches if any clan listed on the card matches 
any clan in the list.</li>
<li><em>Discipline</em>: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card. You must specify 
a <a href="#list">list</a> of disciplines. A card matches if any discipline listed on the 
card matches any discipline in the list. This filter ignores discipline levels.</li>
<li><em>Group</em>: Filter on the group of a crypt card. You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> 
of groups. A card matches if its group matches any group in the list.</li>
<li><em>Capacity</em>: Filter on the capacity listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of capacities. A card matches if its capacity matches any capacity 
in the list.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Filter on the cost which must be paid for the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of costs. A card matches if its cost matches any cost in the list 
numerically. This filter ignores the cost type, and considers only the numerical 
cost. If you wish to filter on a specific cost and cost type, you must combine 
this filter with the <em>Cost Type</em> filter.</li>
<li><em>Life (Crypt)</em>: Filter on the life value of a crypt card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of life values. A card matches if the life value listed on the card 
matches any life value in the list. This filter only matches crypt cards which 
have a life value (currently the Imbued), and does not match library cards which 
have a life value (other allies, and retainers).</li>
<li><em>Creed</em>: Filter on the creed(s) listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of creeds. A card matches if any creed listed on the card matches 
any creed in the list.</li>
<li><em>Virtue</em>: Filter on the virtue(s) listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of virtues. A card matches if any virtue listed on the card matches 
any virtue in the list.</li>
<li><em>Card Text</em>: Filter on the text of the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card matches if the string appears in the card text. This 
filter ignores the card name. You can use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> 
characters.</li>
<li><em>Card Name</em>: Filter on the name of the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card matches if the string appears in the card name. You can 
use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Filter on the sect(s) listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of sects. A card matches if any sect listed on the card matches any 
sect in the list.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Filter on the vampire title(s) listed on the card. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of titles. A card matches if any title listed on the card matches 
any title in the list.</li>
<li><em>Expansion with Rarity</em>: Filter on the expansions and rarities in which the 
card has been printed. You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of expansion and rarity 
combinations. A card matches if it has been printed in one of the given 
expansion and rarity combinations. This filter considers all the expansions and 
rarities in which a card has ever been printed, and ignores the specific 
physical expansion information on the card. If you want to filter on a card&#8217;s 
physical expansion information, use the <em>Physical Expansion</em> filter.</li>
<li><em>Discipline with Level</em>: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card and 
their levels. You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of discipline and level 
combinations. A crypt card matches if any discipline listed on the card, and its 
listed level, match any combination in the list. This filter is intended to be 
used to find vampires&#8212;presently, all library cards which have a discipline 
requirement have that discipline associated with them at the superior level. 
This filter treats different levels of the same discipline as different and 
unrelated disciplines, so a list which contains only the inferior version of a 
discipline will not match a card which has the superior version of that 
discipline.</li>
<li><em>Physical Expansion</em>: Filter on a card&#8217;s expansion information. You must 
specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of expansions. A card matches if its listed expansion 
matches any expansion in the list. This is different from the 
<em>Expansion_with_Rarity</em> filter, since it ignores rarities, and matches the 
specific physical expansion of the card, not the list of expansions in which the 
card has been printed.</li>
<li><em>Card Sets</em>: You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of card sets. A card matches if 
it belongs to at least one set in the list.</li>
<li><em>In Card Sets In Use</em>: A card matches if it belongs to a card set which is 
marked as <em>In Use</em>. This filter has no parameters.</li>
<li><em>Card Count</em>: Filter on card count within the current card set or a different 
card set. You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of card counts, and a single card set. 
A card matches if it belongs to the specified set, and has a count within that 
set equal to any count in the list.</li>
<li><em>Card Function</em>: Filter on common card functions. You must specify a 
<a href="#list">list</a> of card functions. A card matches if it satisfies at least one 
function in the list.</li>
<li><em>Sub-Filter</em>: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See 
<a href="#combining">Combining Basic Filters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use these filters in the <a href="#lookup">Card Lookup Dialog</a> during a card 
set import&#8212;they can assist you in finding matches for unknown cards.</p>

<p>Currently, the only way to filter on the properties of a merged vampire, such as 
different discipline levels, is to filter on the card text.</p>

<h3 id="card_set_filters">Card Set Filters</h3>

<p>These filters apply to the card set list. The following basic filters are 
supported.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Card Set Name</em>: Filter on the card set name. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set&#8217;s 
name. You can use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Description</em>: Filter on the card set description. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set&#8217;s 
description. You can use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Author</em>: Filter on the card set author. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set&#8217;s 
author name. You can use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Annotations</em>: Filter on the card set annotations. You must specify a 
<a href="#string">string</a>. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set&#8217;s 
annotations. You can use % and _ as <a href="#wildcard">wildcard</a> characters.</li>
<li><em>Parent Card Set</em>: You must specify a <a href="#list">list</a> of card sets. A card set 
matches if any card set in the list is its parent set.</li>
<li><em>Card Set Marked as in Use</em>: A card set matches if it is marked as <em>In Use</em>.</li>
<li><em>Sub-Filter</em>: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See 
<a href="#combining">Combining Basic Filters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When Sutekh displays card sets which match a filter, all the direct ancestors of 
those sets are also displayed even if they do not match the filter themselves, 
so that the matching sets can be shown in their correct position in the 
hierarchy.</p>

<h3 id="combining">Combining Basic Filters</h3>

<p>You can combine filters by using filter boxes to group the basic filters 
together.</p>

<p>There are four types of filter box:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>All of</em>: This filter matches only if every filter in the box matches.</li>
<li><em>Any of</em>: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box 
matches.</li>
<li><em>Not all of</em>: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box 
doesn&#8217;t match.</li>
<li><em>Not any of</em>: This filter matches only if every filter in the box doesn&#8217;t 
match.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each filter box can also contain sub-filters, which are themselves 
filter boxes. You can thus construct complex queries by nesting multiple filter 
boxes.</p>

<h3 id="string">String filters</h3>

<p>Several filters check a string which you specify against a particular text 
property. They will match if the given string is a substring of the 
property.</p>

<p>String filters are case-insensitive: for example, if you use the <em>Card Name</em> 
filter, the string <strong>the</strong> will match both <strong>Weigh the Heart</strong> and 
<strong>Yuri, The Talon</strong>.</p>

<p>String filters can also use two different wildcard characters:</p>

<p><strong>_</strong> will match any single character. Thus <strong>a_c</strong> will match both <strong>abc</strong> and <strong>aec</strong>, 
but not <strong>abdc</strong> or <strong>abd</strong>. <strong>_</strong> will never match the empty string, so <strong>Th_e</strong> will 
not match <strong>The</strong>, but will match <strong>Thee</strong></p>

<p><strong>%</strong> will match any sequence of characters. So <strong>a%c</strong> will match any of <strong>abc</strong>, 
<strong>aec</strong> or <strong>abdegfthc</strong>, but not <strong>abdefg</strong>. <strong>%</strong> will also match the empty string, so 
<strong>Th%e</strong> will match both <strong>The</strong> and <strong>Three</strong>.</p>

<p>Wildcards can be used multiple times in the same filter string. So <strong>a_b%e</strong> will 
match any of <strong>acbde</strong>, <strong>aebe</strong> or <strong>aebfe</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="list">List filters</h3>

<p>Several filters check a list of possible options which you specify against some 
property. They will match if the value of the property matches any item in the 
given list.</p>

<p>Thus, if you use the <em>Clan</em> filter and specify both <strong>Tremere</strong> and <strong>Toreador</strong>, it 
will match cards which list either of these clans.</p>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugin List</h2>

<h3 id="backup_plugin">Backup</h3>

<p>This allows you either to save or to restore a full backup of the current 
database. The backup is saved as a zip file, and is independent of the 
database back-end which Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used 
to transfer the complete state between different databases.</p>

<p>There are two options offered by the plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Save a Full Backup</em>: Save the current state (card sets and their contents) 
to the specified zip file.</li>
<li><em>Restore a Full Backup</em>: Import all the card sets from the specified zip file. 
Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently in the database 
with the contents of the backup.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can save a backup at any time. Sutekh will ask you whether you would like to 
save a backup when you initiate certain actions, such as updating the White Wolf 
card list.</p>

<h3 id="images_plugin">Card Images</h3>

<p>This plugin allows you to configure the card images pane.</p>

<p>The images pane can be configured in three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Download and install cardimages from feldb.extra.hu</em>: Attempt to 
download the images from the <span class="caps">FELDB</span> website, and make them available to 
Sutekh. The zip file is quite large, so this option may take some time.</li>
<li><em>Install images from a local zip file</em>: If a zip file containing the 
images is available, Sutekh can install directly from this file.</li>
<li><em>Choose a directory containing the images</em>: If the images have already been 
installed for some other reason (such as an existing <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">FELDB</span> 
installation), this option will direct Sutekh to reuse that installation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cluster_plugin">Cluster Cards</h3>

<p>The clustering plugin attempts to group cards from a card list into sets 
(clusters) of cards with similar properties. It is designed to allow you 
to explore subsets of your cards, and perhaps to look for groups of cards which 
might provide starting points for deck construction. The clustering tool is 
currently quite slow, so be patient when waiting for large card lists to be 
grouped (it will finish eventually).</p>

<p>When you open the clustering plugin, you will be presented with three tabs: 
<em>Select Columns</em>, <em>Settings</em> and <em>Results</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Select Columns</em> tab is where you select the properties for the plugin to 
consider when grouping the cards. Properties are organised into categories for 
ease of selection. If you are unsure which properties to select, start by 
selecting the disciplines and clans which you find the most interesting.</p>

<p>In the <em>Settings</em> tab, you can tweak the clustering algorithm parameters. 
The plugin implements K-means clustering using K-means++ to determine the 
initial cluster centers, followed by Lloyd&#8217;s method of iteratively refining the 
clusters. Three parameters can be set:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Number of iterations</em>: Number of Lloyd refinement steps to perform. Setting 
more steps makes the clustering take longer, but setting fewer steps may result 
in a less optimal grouping. Ten steps should be sufficient for most cases.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Number of clusters</em>: By default, the plugin creates one cluster per 80 cards 
(this being the size of a deck), but the number of clusters may also be set 
manually.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Distance measure</em>: Two distance metrics are currently supported. The 
Euclidean distance setting clusters using the usual N-dimensional vector space 
metric. The Sutekh distance metric modifies the Euclidean metric to make 
property values of -1 (used internally by Sutekh to mark costs of X and the <span class="caps">ANY</span> 
crypt group) close to all others and values of zero slightly further away than 
usual. If in doubt, leave the metric set to the Sutekh distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the property columns have been selected and the parameters set, use the 
<em>Execute</em> button to begin the clustering. When clustering is complete, the 
<em>Results</em> tab will be populated.</p>

<p>The results are presented as a table. Each row corresponds to a cluster of 
cards. The first column contains checkboxes. Use these to select which clusters 
to use to create card sets, then click the 
<em>Make Cards Sets from Selected Clusters</em> button at the bottom of the results. 
The second column contains the cluster number, which enables you to determine 
which clusters correspond to the created card sets. The third column shows how 
many cards are present in each cluster, and the last lists the property 
values of the cluster center (property values of zero are omitted).</p>

<h3 id="stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</h3>

<p>This plugin shows an analysis of all the different clans in the White Wolf 
card list. For each clan, it displays the total number of vampires in the clan, 
the sum of the vampires&#8217; capacities, and the most common disciplines. It also 
shows the score for the disciplines, and various stats about how the disciplines 
are distributed.</p>

<p>You can expand the tree view to show the details for each legal grouping 
combination.</p>

<p>The score is intended to give you some indication of how common 
disciplines are within the clan. Vampires without a discipline score 0 for that 
discipline, vampires with the inferior discipline score 1 and vampires 
with the superior discipline score 2.</p>

<h3 id="grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</h3>

<p>By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types.   You can change 
the grouping with this menu option.</p>

<p>The following groupings are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds</em>: Group cards by the Clan(s) or Creed(s) listed on the card. 
The Imbued Creeds are treated as if they were Vampire Clans.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues</em>: Group cards by the Discipline(s) or Virtue(s) 
listed on the card. The Imbued Virtues are treated as if they were Vampire 
Disciplines.</li>
<li><em>Crypt or Library</em>: Split the card list into crypt and library cards.</li>
<li><em>Card Type</em>: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping 
treats multi-type cards, such as <strong>Action Modifier/Combat</strong> cards as members of 
both the <strong>Action Modifier</strong> and the <strong>Combat</strong> groups.</li>
<li><em>Expansion</em>: Group by the expansions in which the cards have been printed.</li>
<li><em>Rarity</em>: Group the cards by the published rarity.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Group cards by the Sects listed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Group cards by the political titles listed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Group cards by the cost of the card.</li>
<li><em>Multi Card Type</em>: Behaves like the <em>Card Type</em> grouping, but treats 
multi-type cards as members of separate types. Thus <strong>Action Modifier/Combat</strong> 
will appear as a separate group, and cards of that type will not be listed in 
the <strong>Action Modifier</strong> and <strong>Combat</strong> groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</h3>

<p>By default, Sutekh only shows card names in the White Wolf Card List, 
and card names and card counts in other card set lists. You can select 
additional columns to display using this plugin. Possible extra columns are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds:</em> Show the Clans or Creeds listed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Group:</em> Show the group number for the card.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues:</em> Show the Disciplines or Virtues listed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Card Type:</em> Show the card type.</li>
<li><em>Expansions:</em> Show the expansions in which the card has been printed.</li>
<li><em>Capacity or Life (Imbued):</em> Show the capacity associated with the card, or 
its life, if it is an Imbued crypt card. The life of other ally and retainer 
cards is not shown.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Show the Sect associated with the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Show the political titles listed on the card, if it is a crypt card. 
Titles listed on library cards will not be shown.</li>
<li><em>Card Text</em>: Show the text printed on the card.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Show the cost of the card, together with the cost type.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can sort the display by a particular column by clicking on the column 
header. Click on the same header repeatedly to toggle between ascending and 
descending order.</p>

<p>Cards which have equal values within the column selected for sorting are further 
sorted by the card name. Because the different cost types aren&#8217;t comparable, if 
you choose to sort by cost, cards will be grouped by cost type first and sorted 
within those types.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded the icons from the White Wolf site, you will be able to 
toggle the display between the <em>Show Icons and Names</em>, <em>Show Text only</em> and 
<em>Show Icons only</em> options using the radio buttons provided. This setting will 
affect all selected columns that can use icons.</p>

<h3 id="set_exp_plugin">Set selected cards to a single expansion</h3>

<p>This plugin searches for expansions which are common to all the selected cards, 
and allows you to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all the 
selected cards is set to this choice.</p>

<h3 id="compare_plugin">Compare with another Card Set</h3>

<p>This plugin compares the current card set with a different card set. It displays 
which cards are common to both card sets, and lists the unique cards in each 
card set.</p>

<p>By default, the plugin ignores the expansions of cards, and considers all 
cards with the same name to be the same. You can change this behaviour using the 
<em>Consider Expansions as well</em> checkbox when selecting a card set for comparison.</p>

<h3 id="analyze_plugin">Analyze Deck</h3>

<p>This plugin examines a card set and displays various statistics about it which 
are intended to give you some indication of how the card set will operate as a 
deck.</p>

<p>It displays several tabs, each of which summarises different aspects 
of the card set. The first tab summarises some basic information about the 
entire set. The second tab implements Legbiter&#8217;s Happy Family analysis for 
the card set. The remaining tabs consider specific card types.</p>

<p>The happy family implementation allows you either to select the number of 
disciplines to use, or to select the disciplines to consider manually.</p>

<h3 id="indep_plugin">Test Card Set Independence</h3>

<p>This plugin tests the current card set against other card sets with the same 
parent, and considers whether there are enough cards in the parent card set to 
simultaneously construct all the selected sets. Multiple decks can be selected 
from the list of card sets.</p>

<p>You can test the current card set against all sets with the same parent which 
are marked as <em>In Use</em> by checking the <em>Test against all card sets marked as in use</em> 
checkbox when selecting decks for comparison. This checkbox overrides any 
selected entries in the list.</p>

<p>The first tab of the results displays the full list of cards of which there is a 
shortage in the parent card set. For each selected set which includes any of 
these cards, the list of cards relevant to that set is shown in a separate tab.</p>

<h3 id="opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</h3>

<p>This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the 
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended 
to give you some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition, 
you can generate example opening hands and crypts by clicking the 
<em>Draw sample hand</em> button.</p>

<h3 id="prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</h3>

<p>This plugin displays the probabilities of drawing the selected cards from the 
library or the crypt. Unlike the <em>simulate opening hand</em> plugin, this plugin 
displays results for longer sequences of card draws.</p>

<p>The first row of the table shows the probabilities of drawing a single card in 
the selected list. Sub-rows show the individual probabilities for each possible 
combination of selected cards. The second row shows the probabilities of 
drawing all possible combinations of two selected cards, etc..</p>

<p>Each probability cell in the table displays two values: the probability of 
drawing at least that combination of cards, and the probability of drawing 
exactly that combination of cards (shown in brackets).</p>

<p>The plugin has the following settings:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>columns in table</em>: Set the number of draws shown in the table. You must 
specify a number from one to eight (the default is eight). The first column 
shows the probabilities of drawing the given cards in your opening hand or crypt 
draw. Subsequent columns show the total probabilities of drawing the cards after 
you have drawn the number of extra cards shown in the column header.</li>
<li><em>step between columns</em>: Set the number of cards drawn between columns. You 
must specify a number from one to ten (the default is one).</li>
<li><em>cards of interest</em>: Set the number of rows in the table. You must specify a 
number from one to the total number of cards selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The selected changes are only applied when you press the the <em>recalculate table</em> 
button.</p>

<h3 id="rulebook_plugin">Rulebook</h3>

<p>This plugin allows you to download copies of the rulebook, imbued rules and card 
rulings from the White Wolf site, or to install previously downloaded copies. 
Once you have downloaded the rulebook files, you can open them in a web browser 
using the <em>Rulebook</em> submenu in the <em>Plugins</em> menu on the <em>Main Window</em>. To 
download the files, or update your existing copies, use the 
<em>Configure Rulebook Plugin</em> item in the same submenu.</p>
