h2(#intro). The Initial Layout

When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following four
panes:

* Full Card List
* Card Text
* Card Set List
* My Collection

On subsequent runs, Sutekh will read the list of panes to display from it's
config file.  You can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly
saving the layout using *Save current pane set* in *File->Preferences*, or by
setting the *Save Pane Set on Exit* option save the configuration.

h3. The Full card list

Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by the V:EKN as the
_Full Card List_. It lists the cards and the expansions in which each card
has appeared.

h3. Card Text

This pane displays information about the currently selected card.

h3. Card Sets

In Sutekh, collections of cards are card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called _My Collection_
is created, to store the details of your card collection.

h3. My Collection

This card set will store the details of your card collection.

h2(#cards). Working with Cards

h3. Adding cards to a card set

Card Sets are by default not editable. You can change this property by toggling
the *Card Set is Editable* menu entry in the *Edit* Menu of the pane.  Before
adding cards to a card set, ensure that it is editable.

For convenience, when a card set is first created, it is opened as editable.

You can add cards by dragging them from the _Full Card List_ to the pane
of the card set. You can also use the copy and paste options from the edit menu.
If you copy multiple cards, you will add a single copy of each distinct selected
card to the destination set. If you have selected multiple copies of the same
card, only one copy will be added.

If a card set is editable, *+* and *-* buttons are displayed next to the card
names. You can use these to increase or decrease the number of copies of a card
that are present in the set.

You can also change this value using the keyboard. You can type *+* and *-* to
increment or decrement the count of a selected card, or type a number from one
to nine to set the value directly.

You can also copy and paste or drag and drop cards from other card sets. If you
do this, all copies of each selected card which are in the source set will be
added to the destination set.

You can select all the cards in a card set using either *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-A* or
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-/*, and unselect all selected cards using
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-A*.

h3. Removing cards

You can remove cards from a card set by using the *-* button shown in the card
set pane next to the card name, by using the keyboard shortcuts to change
the number of cards, or by selecting cards and using the *Delete selection*
option in the *Edit* menu.

h2(#panes). Manipulating Panes

The Sutekh user interface consists of panes. The number of panes and the layout
is entirely configurable.

You can add panes using the *Add Pane* Menu, and replace the contents of the
currently selected pane using the *Replace Pane* Menu. You can also add new
blank panes by splitting the current pane; either into two panes next to each
other, or into two panes stacked one above the other. You can swap two panes by
dragging one onto the other.

When you double-click on an entry in the _Card Set_ list, the card set will be
opened in a new pane added on the right. You can also open a card set in a
specific pane by dragging the card set name from the _Card Set_ list to the
desired pane.

If the *Save Pane Set on Exit* option in the *File->Preferences* menu is
set, Sutekh will save the current layout when you exit, and restore it on
startup. You can also save the current layout using the *Save Current Pane Set*
option.

You can remove panes from the list using the *Pane Actions->Remove current pane*
menu option (or the associated keyboard shortcut). If you delete a card set, its
pane will be closed automatically.

h2(#sets). Managing Card Sets

h3. Creating a new card set

You can create a new card set in the _Card Set List_ using the
*Create New Card Set* option in the *Actions* menu. The name is required, and
must be unique. You can specify that a card set is a subset of a another
card set, by selecting an existing card set to be it's parent, or
you can not select a parent, in which case it will be a stand-alone card set.

For each card set, you can add the author information, a description and
annotations about the card set. Both the description and annotations entries
are free form text entries, and can be formatted as desired.

h3. Renaming a card set.

You can rename a card set using the *Edit Card Set Properties* option in the
*Actions* menu of the card set list pane. You can also rename an open card set
using the *Edit Card Set Properties* option in the *Actions* Menu of the card
set pane.

h3. Changing the parent of a card set.

You can change the parent of a card set by using the *Edit Card Set Properties*
option in the *Actions* Menu, or by dragging the selected card set onto its
new parent in the card set list pane. To change a card set to have no parent,
you have to use the *Edit Card Set Properties* option and unselect the
existing parent using either *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;space&gt;* or
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;left button&gt;*.

h3. Deleting a card set

You can delete a card set using the *Delete card set* option in the *Actions*
menu of the card set list pane. You can also delete an open card set using the
*Delete card set* option in the *Actions* menu of the card set pane.

h3. _In Use_ Card sets

Card sets can be marked or unmarked as _In Use_. _In Use_ card sets
are considered to be those which are currently active. Display modes which
show child card sets only consider child cards sets which are marked as
_In Use_.

h3. The Different card display and count modes

Sutekh has several settings which control which cards are displayed in a card set
pane, and what information about the cards is displayed.

The display of cards will also be affected by any "filters":#filtering that are
applied.

h4. The _Cards to Show_ options

This setting controls which cards are displayed.

The default mode shows only those cards that belong to the actual card set.

_Show All Cards_ shows the entire list of cards. This mode is often useful
when you are entering cards into a card set for the first time.

_Show all cards in parent card set_ shows the combination of the cards in this
card set and all the cards in the parent card set. It is useful for seeing
which cards are available to be added to a deck.

_Show all cards in child card sets_ shows all cards that belong to the
_In Use_ children of this card set in addition to the cards in this card
set.

h4. The _Display Mode_ options

This setting controls what information is displayed below the card name.

_Show Expansions_ shows the expansions of the cards, and a card count for each
expansion. This is the default.

_Show No Children_ disables the display of additional information below the
card name.

_Show Child Card Sets_ shows the allocation of cards to the _In Use_ children
of the current card set.

_Show Expansions and Child Card Sets_ shows the expansion information as well as
the child card set breakdown for each expansion.

_Show Child Card Sets and Expansions_ is the reverse of
_Show Expansions and Child Card Sets_. It shows the child card sets and the
expansion breakdown for each child card set.

h4. The _Parent Card Count_ options

If the card set is the child of another card set, you can also display
information about the parent card set.

_Show Parent Count_ shows the count of the same card in the parent card set.
This is the default.

_Don't show parent card counts_ disables the column with the parent count.

_Show difference between Parent Count and this card set_ shows the difference
between the parent count and the count for this card set.

_Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use_ shows the
difference between the parent card set count and the total count in all
_In Use_ card sets. If this card set is not _In Use_, then the number of
cards in this set does not influence this number.

h2(#filtering). Filtering

Sutekh has a very powerful filtering model, which allows you to perform quite
complex queries on the card database.

h3. The Basic filters

There are several basic filters available, such as _Clan_, _Discipline_,
_Card Text_ etc..

Most of these filters allow only a limited range of options, which you can
select from the list. The _Clan_ filter, for example, only accepts the
clans listed in the database as input. You can select multiple clans, and the
filter will match a card if it matches any of the selected clans.

Other filters, such as the _Card Text_ filter, require you to enter a string.
The filter will match any card with card text that contains this string. The *%*
and *_* characters can be used as wildcards: *%* will match any number of
letters, and *_* will match exactly one.

The _Card Sets In Use_ filter takes no input.

The _Card Count_ filter requires you to input a list of card counts and a list
of card sets.

h3. Combing basic filters

You can combine these basic filters to create more complex queries by placing
filters inside a filter group.

Multiple filters can be combined according to one of the following rules:

_All of_ requires all of the included filters to be satisfied simultaneously.
It is useful for finding cards which require a discipline and a given cost, for
example.

_Any of_ requires that at least one of the included filters is satisfied.

_Not All of_ requires that at least one of the included filters is not
satisfied. The difference between _Not All of_ and _Any of_ is that
_Any of_ will include the results of any cards that match all of the filters,
while _Not All of_ will exclude those, but return cards that satisfy none of
the filters.

_None of_ requires that none of the included filters be satisfied.

A Filter Group can be added to an existing Filter Group, which allows
combinations to be nested. Thus an _All of_ filter can include _Any of_ or
_None of_ filters below it, which allows for extremely complex queries to
be constructed.

For example, to find all cards that require either *Follower of Set* or
*Serpentis*, but not both, you could construct the following filter:

An _Any of_ filter, which includes two _All of_ sub-filters. Each
sub-filter includes the _Clan_ and _Discipline_ basic filters, and one is
set to match *Followers of Set* and NOT *Serpentis* while the other is set to
match NOT *Followers of Set* and *Serpentis*.

Once you have constructed a filter, you can name and save it, and load it again
later.

h3. Filtering the Card Set List

You can also filter the card set list. The basic filters available here are:

* The card set name
* The card set author
* The card set description
* The name of the parent card set
* Text in the annotations of the card set
* All card sets marked in use

You can also combine these filters, and create queries such as
*All card sets in use where the card set name includes _Nosferatu_*.

When Sutekh displays card sets which match a filter, all the direct ancestors of
those sets are also displayed even if they do not match the filter themselves,
so that the matching sets can be shown in their correct position in the
hierarchy.


h2(#profiles). Profiles

h3. Overview

Sutekh has a lot of options for customising the way a card set is displayed.
These options are controlled by the profile feature. Profiles are available
for individual card sets, the WW cardlist and the card set list.

You can create several profiles and switch between them easily using the
*Cardset profile*, *Cardlist profile* or *CardSet List profile* menus as
required. Profiles are saved and will be re-applied one the next run.

In addition, for card sets, there's the *Pane profile* menu. You can have
multiple copies of a card set open at the same time. The cardset profile
choice applies to all open copies of the same card set, while the
*pane profile* overrides that for a specific pane. 

There's also the *local profile*, which makes changes that *aren't* saved
in the config file. This is useful for making quick changes to the local
view that you don't want to keep or apply to other panes using the same
profile.

h3. Group by

The *Group by* option controls the top level division used to arrange the cards.
By default, this is the *CardType* grouping, which groups cards together by
their card types (Vampire, Master, Action, etc.). Other groupings
include: *Clan or Creed*, to arrange on clans, *Group*, to arrange
by the vampire grouping and *Cost* to arrange by card cost.

h3. Extra Columns

The *Extra Columns* option allows you to specify additional information
about the cards to be displayed in the pane. These extra columns can also
be used to sort the card set, which can be useful with columns such as
*Cost* or *Capacity*.

h3. Filter

The *Filter* option in the profile allows you to specify a saved filter
that is always applied when this profile is used. This is can be used
to create specify views of a card set, such as showing all vampires
grouped by clan or so forth.


h2(#tips). Useful Tips

h3. Entering card sets

The different display modes are often useful for entering a card set quickly.
Start with with _Show all cards_ or _Show cards in parent card set_ and
then increment the cards which you wish to add to the current card set.
You can also use the _Card Set from Filter_ option to create a card set.

When you import card sets from other formats, the expansion information may be
missing, in which case these cards will be imported without an expansion. If you
know that all the imported cards are from the same expansion -- for example, if
the card set is a starter deck -- you can use the
_Set selection to single expansion_ option from the _Actions_ menu to set all
the cards to the correct expansion quickly.

h3. Search for cards and card sets

While it quite easy to use filters to restrict the cards or card sets shown,
to find a specific card, the search dialog is often faster.

The search dialog can be popped by either using the _Edit->Search_ menu
option, the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F* shortcut, or by typing directly into the list
view.

The dialog can be hidden by either pressing the *Escape* key, the *Enter* key,
or by clicking outside the search dialog. Note that, to prevent unexpected
side-effects, while the search dialog is shown, clicking will only hide
the dialog and not effect any else.

The search looks to match names starting with the typed text. When multiple
cards match, you can easily move between them by using the up or down keys
while the search dialog is visible.

The _Use "path of ..., the" name display_ preference controls how cards
that start with "The", "An" or "A" are displayed. If set, the prefix
is displayed at the end. This also effects how the card name search matches
the cards.

h3. Opening multiple copies of the card set

It's possible to open multiple copies of a given card set. This can be useful
for displaying different sets of extra columns for different filters, and so
forth. Open another copy of the card set either by dragging the card set name
from the card set list onto a different pane, or by double clicking the card set
name.

h3. Organising card sets

It's often useful to keep a record of card sets that are related, but aren't
strictly subsets of another card set. One common approach is to use empty
card sets to act as card set *holders* which group logically related
card sets together.

h3. Tracking the history of a card set

The _Take a snapshot of this card set_ option can be used to keep a history of
how a card set evolves. Snapshots are children of the current card set, so the
different view modes can be used and the _Compare with another Card Set_ can be
used to see how a card set has changed between different versions.

h3. Separating crypt and library views.

It is sometimes useful to work with the crypt and library of a card set
separately, showing different information about both. The easiest way is to
open two copies of the card set, and use different pane profiles for each. The
crypt profile should include a filter that selects crypt cards and display the
desired extra information (Clan, Capacity, etc.), while the library profile
should filter on non-crypt cards and show columns such as cost or disciplines.
