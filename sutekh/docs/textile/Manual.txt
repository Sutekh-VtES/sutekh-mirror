h2(#intro). Introduction

If you are new to Sutekh, try reading "The Sutekh Tutorial":Tutorial.html.


h2(#concepts). Important Concepts

Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: Cards and Card Sets.

Cards are the individual cards as described by the official white wolf
card list. Each card describes all the relevant properties of the card,
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest
text for the card.

Card Sets are collections of cards and describe the card and the number of copies
of that card in the collection. An important concept is that card sets can
be related in a parent-child hierarchy. A typical setup is to have a single card
set for the main card collection (usually the *My Collection* card set), and
other card sets, which represent the constructed decks, as children of this
card set, but many other arrangements are possible.


h2(#main). Main Window

The main sutekh window can be split into a number of different panes.

The following panes are supported:

* "The White Wolf card list":#ww
* "The Card Set List":#card_set_list
* "Card Text":#card_text
* "Card Image":#card_image
* "Card Set":#cardsets panes

Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane.
The main window has a menu for global actions.

h3(#keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:

One can cycle between different panes using the *&lt;Tab&gt;* key.

The currently active pane can be closed using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W* shortcut.

For panes which support filtering, the filter editing dialog can be activated
using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S* (for specify filter), and the current filter can be
toggled on and off by using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T*.

The *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+* and *&lt;Ctrl&gt;--* shortcuts allow the entire tree displayed in a
pane to either be fuly expanded or completely collapsed.

h3(#cardsets_keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

For card sets, the following additional keybaord shortcuts exist.

The editable state of the card set can be toggled using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E*.

The current selection can be copied to the clipboard using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C*

If the card set is editable, the current selection can be deleted using *&lt;Del&gt;*
or pasted into the card set using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V*

For an editable card set, the card number for the entire selection can be set
in the range 1 to 9 directly by entering the number directly, or all the number
for all cards in the selection can either be incremented or decremented by
1 using either *+* or *-* respectively. If the card set is not editable, these
keys have no effect.
