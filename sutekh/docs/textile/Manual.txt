h2(#intro). Introduction

If you are new to Sutekh, try reading "The Sutekh Tutorial":Tutorial.html.


h2(#concepts). Important Concepts

Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: _Cards_ and
_Card Sets_.

_Cards_ are the individual cards as described by the official White Wolf
card list. Sutekh describes all the relevant properties of each card,
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest
card text.

You can set the expansion to which each specific card belongs. This
allows you to distinguish between multiple copies of the same card from
different expansions. If the expansion is not set, Sutekh notes this as
*Unknown Expansion* in the card set view.

_Card Sets_ are collections of cards, and describe each card and the number of
copies of that card in the collection. Card sets can be related in a
parent-child hierarchy. In a typical setup, there is a single card set for the
main card collection (usually the *My Collection* card set); and other card
sets, which represent constructed decks, are children of this card set -- but
many other arrangements are possible.


h2(#main). Main Window

You can split the main Sutekh window into a number of different panes.

The following panes are supported:

* "The White Wolf card list":#ww
* "The Card Set List":#card_set_list
* "Card Text":#card_text
* "Card Image":#card_image
* "Card Set":#cardsets panes

Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane.
The main window has a menu for global actions.

You can easily rearrange panes. You can swap two panes by dragging one onto the
other.

h3(#main_file). File

The file menu has the following options.

* _Import Card Set_: Import a card set from a existing file. The following
file types are supported:
** _Load Card Set from File_: Load a card set saved in Sutekh's XML file
format.
** _Import CSV File_: "Import a card set from a comma-separated value
file":#csv_plugin, as produced by a spreadsheet. You can select the columns
for card set, number and expansion.
** _Import ARDB or ELDB Card Set_: "Import a file":#import_plugin
saved by either ARDB or FELDB. You must specify the correct type of file as well
as the file name.
** _Import Card Sets from zip file_: Select "card sets from a zip
file":#import_zip_plugin to import.
* _Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings_: Update the
database with a new cardlist and/or rulings file. You can either specify local
files, or opt to download them from the White Wolf website directly. Sutekh may
encounter problems when updating the card list after a new expansion has been
published -- this is discussed further in the section
"Refreshing the White Wolf Card List"#refresh.
* _Download VTES icons_: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf
website.
* _Preferences_: Manage various preferences.
** _Save Current Pane Set_: Save the current configuration of the panes.
** _Save Pane Set on Exit_: Save the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.
** _Save Exact Pane Positions_: Save the exact pane positions on exit.
** _Save Window Size_: Save the window size on exit.
* _Restore saved configuration_: Restore the panes to the saved configuration.
* _Quit_: Exit Sutekh.

If Sutekh encounters an unknown card when importing card sets, it will prompt
you to identify it using the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup.

h3(#main_pane_actions). Pane Actions

This menu allows you to manage the panes in Sutekh. The _Pane Actions_ menu
has the following options:

* _Equalize pane sizes_: Rearrange the panes so that each pane has the
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.
* _Split current pane horizontally_: Split the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the
active pane. The two panes will be the same height as, and half the width of the
pane being split.
* _Split current pane vertically_: Split the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two
panes will be the same width as, and half the height of the pane being split. It
is not possible to split panes vertically multiple times.
* _Add New Pane_: Add a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of
the main window.
* _Replace Pane_: Replace the currently active pane with another. The available
options will be presented in a submenu.
* _Close Pane_: Close the currently active pane.


h3(#main_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the main menu:

* "Backup":#backup_plugin
* "Card Images":#images_plugin


h3(#keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:

You can cycle between different panes using the *&lt;Tab&gt;* key.

You can close the currently active pane using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W* shortcut.

In panes which support filtering, you can activate the filter editing dialog
using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S* (for "*S*pecify filter"), and toggle the current filter
on and off using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T*.

The *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+* and *&lt;Ctrl&gt;--* shortcuts allow you to expand fully or
collapse completely the entire tree displayed in a pane.


h3(#lookup). Card Lookup Dialog

For various reasons, Sutekh may fail to identify a card correctly when
importing a card set. Names vary ("Spirit's Touch",
"The Spirit's Touch"), special characters can be missing, etc.. When
this happens, Sutekh will prompt you for the correct card.

The card lookup window displays two lists: the list of all White Wolf cards
and the list of unknown cards. Below the unknown card list are options
to specify a "filter":#filters and to apply or unapply the filter.

The unknown card list has two columns -- the name of the unknown card and
the currently selected replacement from the White Wolf card list -- and three
buttons. Use the first button to replace the card with the currently selected
card, the second button to mark the card as ignored, and the last to view a list
of reasonable options (Sutekh finds these by applying a filter based on the
unknown card name).

Once you have selected replacements for all unknown cards (or chosen to ignore
them), use the OK button to create the card set.

If you choose to cancel, the entire import will be aborted and no card set will
be created.

If Sutekh cannot identify an expansion in the file, it will prompt you for the
correct replacement. If Sutekh finds an impossible card and expansion
combination, it will prompt you to resolve the situation using the card lookup
dialog -- but you will have the opportunity to select both the card and the
expansion.


h3(#refresh). Refreshing the White Wolf Card List

This allows Sutekh to update the card list to account for new cards, such
as promos.

Sutekh parses the card list published on the White Wolf site for
information about the cards. When new expansions are published, Sutekh may
require an update to interpret major changes to the cardlist, such as
new clans or card types. If the expansion does not introduce any significant
changes, Sutekh may be able to import the new card list correctly, but may be
unable to interpret the new expansion name. If this happens, Sutekh should
continue working, but you may need to specify the correct mapping for the
expansion when updating the database during your next upgrade.

h2(#ww). White Wolf Card List

This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official
White Wolf card list.

h3(#ww_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Show card expansions_: Toggle display of the card expansions in which each
card was printed below the card name in the list.
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggle whether icons are shown for the top
level grouping (when available).
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#ww_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the
list.
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results
of the current filter.

h3(#ww_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the White Wolf Card List pane menu:

* "Cluster Cards":#cluster_plugin
* "Clan Discipline Stats":#stats_plugin
* "Change Grouping":#grouping_plugin
* "Select Extra Columns":#columns_plugin


h2(#card_text). Card Text

The Card Text Pane displays the text on the card, and any rulings that apply
to the card.

This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups,
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.


h2(#card_image). Card Images

If the "Card Image Plugin":#images_plugin has been configured, this pane
will display the appropriate card image for each pane. By default, all images
are resized to fit the pane. You can change this setting by right-clicking on
the image.

The following options are available:

* _Fit images to the pane_: All images are resized to fit the pane.
* _Show images at fixed size_: All images are resized to 225x300 pixels.
* _Show images at original size_: All images are shown at the original size
of the scan.

If there are multiple images for the given card from the different expansions,
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card.
You can cycle through the available expansions either by left-clicking
on the image, or by selecting the _Show next expansion image_ and
_Show previous expansion image_ options after right-clicking on the frame.


h2(#csv_plugin). Import CSV file

This allows you to import card sets stored as a comma-separated file, a format
commonly produced by spreadsheets. The file must contain a column with card
names and a column with card counts, and can optionally contain a column with
expansions. When you importing the file, you must specify the mapping between
the columns and their contents.

If Sutekh cannot correctly interpret a name or expansion, it will prompt you to
resolve the situation using the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup.

h2(#import_plugin). Import ARDB or ELDB file

This allows you to import files produced by ARDB or FELDB. Sutekh does not
recognise the file format automatically, so you must specify it manually.

For some types of file, such as ARDB inventories, you will also need to specify
a card set name for the imported file.

If the name of the card set clashes with an existing name, you will
be asked to rename the imported card set or cancel the import.

If no cards are found in the card set, the card set will not be created.

h2(#import_zip_plugin). Import card sets from zip file

This plugin allows you to select some or all of the Sutekh Card Sets included
in a zip file (such as those produced by the backup plugin) and import them
into the card set. Unlike the backup plugin, this does not replace any existing
card sets.

After selecting the zip file, you will be asked to select the card sets to
import from the list of card sets in the zip file. If any of the card sets share
the same name as an existing card set, you will be asked either to rename the
card set, or skip importing that card set.

If a card set to be imported has a parent card set, and that set cannot be
found, the card set will be imported with no parent set.

h2(#card_set_list). Card Set List

This pane lists all the card sets which have been defined. The card sets are
arranged so that child card sets are listed below their parents.

You can open a card set either by double-clicking on its name, or by dragging
the name to an existing pane.

You can change the parent of a card set by dragging the card set name onto the
new parent's name.

You can mark sets either as _in use_ or _not in use_. This is intended to
help you track which cards are currently available for you to use in new card
sets.

h3(#card_set_list_actions). Actions

The following actions are available:

* _Create New Card Set_: Create a new card set.
* _Edit Card Set Properties_: Change the card set name, author and comment,
change the parent of the card set, or add annotations to the card set.
* _Mark/Unmark Card Set as In Use_: Toggle whether the card set is _in use_ or
_not in use_.
* _Delete Card Set_: Delete the currently selected card set.
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#card_set_list_filter). Filter

The filter menu has two options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card set list. See the
"Card Set Filters":#card_set_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the
list.

h2(#cardsets). Card Sets

h3(#cardsets_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Edit Card Set Properties_: Change the card set name, author and comment,
change the parent of the card set, or add annotations to the card set.
* _Save Card Set to File_: Save the card set to Sutekh's XML format.
* _Export Card Set_: Export the card set to other file formats. The currently
supported options are:
** _CSV_: A comma-separated format suitable for importing into spreadsheets
** _FELDB file_: A file that can be imported into the FELDB card
manager
** _ARDB XML_: A file that can be imported into the ARDB card manager
** _HTML_: A nice HTML file, similar to that produced by ARDB
** _ARDB Text_: A text file, similar to that produced by ARDB
* _Cards To Show_: Set which cards are displayed. The options are:
** _This Set Only_: Show only the cards in this card set.
** _Show All Cards_: Show all the cards in the White Wolf list. Cards not in
this card set will have a count of 0.
** _Show all cards in parent card set_: Show all the cards in this card set, as
well as any cards in the parent card set that are not in this card set.
** _Show all cards in child card sets_: Show all the cards in this card set, as
well as any cards in those child card sets marked as _In Use_ that are not in
this card set.
* _Display Mode_: Specify what additional information is displayed below the
card names in the tree. The options are:
** _Show No Children_: Display nothing below the card name.
** _Show Expansions_: Show the expansions of the cards, and a card count for each expansion.
** _Show Child Card Sets_: Show the card counts for child card sets marked as
_In Use_.
** _Show Expansions and Child Card Sets_: Show expansions, and within each expansion show counts for child card sets marked as _In Use_.
** _Show Child Card Sets and Expansions_: Show child card sets marked
as _In Use_, and for each child card set show expansion counts.
* _Parent Count Mode_: Specify how the _Parent count_ column is displayed in
card sets with a parent set. The options are:
** _Don't show parent card counts_: Hide the parent count column.
** _Show parent count_: Show only the parent count. If the count for this
card set exceeds the parent count, this number is shown in red.
** _Show difference between parent count and this card set_: Show the
difference between the parent count and this card set's count. If this number
is negative, it is shown in red.
** _Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use_: Show the
difference between the parent count and the total count in all the card sets
marked as _In Use_. If this number is negative, it is shown in red.
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggle whether icons are shown for the top
level grouping (when available).
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.
* _Delete Card Set_: Delete the card set from the database.
* _Print Card Set_: Print the card set.


h3(#cardsets_edit). Edit

This menu has the following options:

* _Card Set is Editable_: Toggle whether the card set is editable. When the card
set is not editable, you may not add cards to the set or delete cards from the
set directly.
* _Copy selection_: Copy the currently selected set of cards into the buffer.
You can paste this into an editable card set to add the selected cards to it.
* _Paste_: Paste the previously copied selection into the current card set.
This option is only available when the card set is editable.
* _Delete selection_: Delete the selected cards from the card set. This
is only possible when the card set is editable. The deleted selection is not
placed in the buffer.

If the card set is not editable, you cannot make changes to its contents
directly. It is still possible for you to change the card set contents by
editing the parent card set when the _Display Mode_ -> _Show Child Card Sets_
option is active.

h3(#cardsets_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the list.
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results
of the current filter.

h3(#cardsets_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the card set pane plugins menu:

* "Cluster Cards":#cluster_plugin
* "Clan Discipline Stats":#stats_plugin
* "Change Grouping":#grouping_plugin
* "Select Extra Columns":#columns_plugin
* "Set selected cards to a single expansion":#set_exp_plugin
* "Compare card set with another Card Set":#compare_plugin
* "Analyze Deck":#analyze_plugin
* "Test Card Set Independence":#indep_plugin
* "Simulate Opening Hand":#opening_hand_plugin
* "Card draw probabilities":#prob_plugin


h3(#cardsets_keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist:

You can toggle the editable state of the card set using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E*.

You can copy the current selection to the clipboard using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C*.

If the card set is editable, you can delete the current selection using
*&lt;Del&gt;* or paste a copied selection into the card set using
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V*.

In an editable card set, you can set the count for all the cards in a selection
to a number from one to ten by typing the number directly. You can increment
and decrement the count for all the cards in a selection using *+* and *-*. If
the card set is not editable, these keys have no effect.


h2(#filters). Filters

Filtering is one of the most common activities in Sutekh. You can construct
complex queries by "combining":#combining various basic filters.

The Filter dialog will display the last used filter for the given pane. You can
clear or modify this filter using the _Clear Filter_ button.

You can save complex filters for later reuse using the _Save_ button, and recall
them using the _Load_ button. When modifying a filter, you can revert to the
saved version using the _Revert Filter_ button.

h3(#card_filters). Card Filters

These filters apply either to the White Wolf card list or a card set. The
following basic filters are supported:

* _Card Type_: Filter on the type of card. You must specify a "list":#list of
card types. A card matches if any one of its types matches any type in the
list.
* _Cost Type_: Filter on the type of cost which must be paid for the card. You
must specify a "list":#list of cost types. The filter ignores the numerical
cost, and considers only the cost type. If you wish to filter on a specific
cost and cost type, you must combine this filter with the _Cost_ filter.
Presently, the recognised types of cost are pool, blood and conviction, and this
filter matches only library cards. Vampire capacity and ally/retainer life are
not considered to be cost types.
* _Clan_: Filter on the clan(s) listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of clans. A card matches if any clan listed on the card matches
any clan in the list.
* _Discipline_: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card. You must specify
a "list":#list of disciplines. A card matches if any discipline listed on the
card matches any discipline in the list. This filter ignores discipline levels.
* _Group_: Filter on the group of a crypt card. You must specify a "list":#list
of groups. A card matches if its group matches any group in the list.
* _Capacity_: Filter on the capacity listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of capacities. A card matches if its capacity matches any capacity
in the list.
* _Cost_: Filter on the cost which must be paid for the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of costs. A card matches if its cost matches any cost in the list
numerically. This filter ignores the cost type, and considers only the numerical
cost. If you wish to filter on a specific cost and cost type, you must combine
this filter with the _Cost Type_ filter.
* _Life (Crypt)_: Filter on the life value of a crypt card. You must specify a
"list":#list of life values. A card matches if the life value listed on the card
matches any life value in the list. This filter only matches crypt cards which
have a life value (currently the Imbued), and does not match library cards which
have a life value (other allies, and retainers).
* _Creed_: Filter on the creed(s) listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of creeds. A card matches if any creed listed on the card matches
any creed in the list.
* _Virtue_: Filter on the virtue(s) listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of virtues. A card matches if any virtue listed on the card matches
any virtue in the list.
* _Card Text_: Filter on the text of the card. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card matches if the string appears in the card text. This
filter ignores the card name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard
characters.
* _Card Name_: Filter on the name of the card. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card matches if the string appears in the card name. You can
use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Sect_: Filter on the sect(s) listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of sects. A card matches if any sect listed on the card matches any
sect in the list.
* _Title_: Filter on the vampire title(s) listed on the card. You must specify a
"list":#list of titles. A card matches if any title listed on the card matches
any title in the list.
* _Expansion with Rarity_: Filter on the expansions and rarities in which the
card has been printed. You must specify a "list":#list of expansion and rarity
combinations. A card matches if it has been printed in one of the given
expansion and rarity combinations. This filter considers all the expansions and
rarities in which a card has ever been printed, and ignores the specific
physical expansion information on the card. If you want to filter on a card's
physical expansion information, use the _Physical Expansion_ filter.
* _Discipline with Level_: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card and
their levels. You must specify a "list":#list of discipline and level
combinations. A crypt card matches if any discipline listed on the card, and its
listed level, match any combination in the list. This filter is intended to be
used to find vampires -- presently, all library cards which have a discipline
requirement have that discipline associated with them at the superior level.
This filter treats different levels of the same discipline as different and
unrelated disciplines, so a list which contains only the inferior version of a
discipline will not match a card which has the superior version of that
discipline.
* _Physical Expansion_: Filter on a card's expansion information. You must
specify a "list":#list of expansions. A card matches if its listed expansion
matches any expansion in the list. This is different from the
_Expansion_with_Rarity_ filter, since it ignores rarities, and matches the
specific physical expansion of the card, not the list of expansions in which the
card has been printed.
* _Card Sets_: You must specify a "list":#list of card sets. A card matches if
it belongs to at least one set in the list.
* _In Card Sets In Use_: A card matches if it belongs to a card set which is
marked as _In Use_. This filter has no parameters.
* _Card Count_: Filter on card count within the current card set or a different
card set. You must specify a "list":#list of card counts, and a single card set.
A card matches if it belongs to the specified set, and has a count within that
set equal to any count in the list.
* _Card Function_: Filter on common card functions. You must specify a
"list":#list of card functions. A card matches if it satisfies at least one
function in the list.
* _Sub-Filter_: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

You can also use these filters in the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup during a card
set import -- they can assist you in finding matches for unknown cards.

Currently, the only way to filter on the properties of a merged vampire, such as
different discipline levels, is to filter on the card text.

h3(#card_set_filters). Card Set Filters

These filters apply to the card set list. The following basic filters are
supported.

* _Card Set Name_: Filter on the card set name. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set's
name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Description_: Filter on the card set description. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set's
description. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Author_: Filter on the card set author. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set's
author name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Annotations_: Filter on the card set annotations. You must specify a
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set's
annotations. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Parent Card Set_: You must specify a "list":#list of card sets. A card set
matches if any card set in the list is its parent set.
* _Card Set Marked as in Use_: A card set matches if it is marked as _In Use_.
* _Sub-Filter_: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

When Sutekh displays card sets which match a filter, all the direct ancestors of
those sets are also displayed even if they do not match the filter themselves,
so that the matching sets can be shown in their correct position in the
hierarchy.


h3(#combining). Combining Basic Filters

You can combine filters by using filter boxes to group the basic filters
together.

There are four types of filter box:

* _All of_: This filter matches only if every filter in the box matches.
* _Any of_: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box
matches.
* _Not all of_: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box
doesn't match.
* _Not any of_: This filter matches only if every filter in the box doesn't
match.

Each filter box can also contain sub-filters, which are themselves
filter boxes. You can thus construct complex queries by nesting multiple filter
boxes.


h3(#string). String filters

Several filters check a string which you specify against a particular text
property. They will match if the given string is a substring of the
property.

String filters are case-insensitive: for example, if you use the _Card Name_
filter, the string *the* will match both *Weigh the Heart* and
*Yuri, The Talon*.

String filters can also use two different wildcard characters:

*_* will match any single character. Thus *a_c* will match both *abc* and *aec*,
but not *abdc* or *abd*. *_* will never match the empty string, so *Th_e* will
not match *The*, but will match *Thee*

*%* will match any sequence of characters. So *a%c* will match any of *abc*,
*aec* or *abdegfthc*, but not *abdefg*. *%* will also match the empty string, so
*Th%e* will match both *The* and *Three*.

Wildcards can be used multiple times in the same filter string. So *a_b%e* will
match any of *acbde*, *aebe* or *aebfe*.

h3(#list). List filters

Several filters check a list of possible options which you specify against some
property. They will match if the value of the property matches any item in the
given list.

Thus, if you use the _Clan_ filter and specify both *Tremere* and *Toreador*, it
will match cards which list either of these clans.


h2(#plugins). Plugin List

h3(#backup_plugin). Backup

This allows you either to save or to restore a full backup of the current
database. The backup is saved as a zip file, and is independent of the
database back-end which Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used
to transfer the complete state between different databases.

There are two options offered by the plugin:

* _Save a Full Backup_: Save the current state (card sets and their contents)
to the specified zip file.
* _Restore a Full Backup_: Import all the card sets from the specified zip file.
Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently in the database
with the contents of the backup.

You can save a backup at any time. Sutekh will ask you whether you would like to
save a backup when you initiate certain actions, such as updating the White Wolf
card list.

h3(#images_plugin). Card Images

This plugin allows you to configure the card images pane.

The images pane can be configured in three ways:

* _Download and install cardimages from feldb.extra.hu_: Attempt to
download the images from the FELDB website, and make them available to
Sutekh. The zip file is quite large, so this option may take some time.
* _Install images from a local zip file_: If a zip file containing the
images is available, Sutekh can install directly from this file.
* _Choose a directory containing the images_: If the images have already been
installed for some other reason (such as an existing ARDB or FELDB
installation), this option will direct Sutekh to reuse that installation.


h3(#cluster_plugin). Cluster Cards

The clustering plugin attempts to group cards from a card list into sets
(clusters) of cards with similar properties. It is designed to allow you
to explore subsets of your cards, and perhaps to look for groups of cards which
might provide starting points for deck construction. The clustering tool is
currently quite slow, so be patient when waiting for large card lists to be
grouped (it will finish eventually).

When you open the clustering plugin, you will be presented with three tabs:
_Select Columns_, _Settings_ and _Results_.

The _Select Columns_ tab is where you select the properties for the plugin to
consider when grouping the cards. Properties are organised into categories for
ease of selection. If you are unsure which properties to select, start by
selecting the disciplines and clans which you find the most interesting.

In the _Settings_ tab, you can tweak the clustering algorithm parameters.
The plugin implements K-means clustering using K-means++ to determine the
initial cluster centers, followed by Lloyd's method of iteratively refining the
clusters. Three parameters can be set:

* _Number of iterations_: Number of Lloyd refinement steps to perform. Setting
more steps makes the clustering take longer, but setting fewer steps may result
in a less optimal grouping. Ten steps should be sufficient for most cases.

* _Number of clusters_: By default, the plugin creates one cluster per 80 cards
(this being the size of a deck), but the number of clusters may also be set
manually.

* _Distance measure_: Two distance metrics are currently supported. The
Euclidean distance setting clusters using the usual N-dimensional vector space
metric. The Sutekh distance metric modifies the Euclidean metric to make
property values of -1 (used internally by Sutekh to mark costs of X and the ANY
crypt group) close to all others and values of zero slightly further away than
usual. If in doubt, leave the metric set to the Sutekh distance.

Once the property columns have been selected and the parameters set, use the
_Execute_ button to begin the clustering. When clustering is complete, the
_Results_ tab will be populated.

The results are presented as a table. Each row corresponds to a cluster of
cards. The first column contains checkboxes. Use these to select which clusters
to use to create card sets, then click the
_Make Cards Sets from Selected Clusters_ button at the bottom of the results.
The second column contains the cluster number, which enables you to determine
which clusters correspond to the created card sets. The third column shows how
many cards are present in each cluster, and the last lists the property
values of the cluster center (property values of zero are omitted).


h3(#stats_plugin). Clan Discipline Stats

This plugin shows an analysis of all the different clans in the White Wolf
card list. For each clan, it displays the total number of vampires in the clan,
the sum of the vampires' capacities, and the most common disciplines. It also
shows the score for the disciplines, and various stats about how the disciplines
are distributed.

You can expand the tree view to show the details for each legal grouping
combination.

The score is intended to give you some indication of how common
disciplines are within the clan. Vampires without a discipline score 0 for that
discipline, vampires with the inferior discipline score 1 and vampires
with the superior discipline score 2.

h3(#grouping_plugin). Change Grouping

By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types.   You can change
the grouping with this menu option.

The following groupings are available:

* _Clans and Creeds_: Group cards by the Clan(s) or Creed(s) listed on the card.
The Imbued Creeds are treated as if they were Vampire Clans.
* _Disciplines and Virtues_: Group cards by the Discipline(s) or Virtue(s)
listed on the card. The Imbued Virtues are treated as if they were Vampire
Disciplines.
* _Crypt or Library_: Split the card list into crypt and library cards.
* _Card Type_: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping
treats multi-type cards, such as *Action Modifier/Combat* cards as members of
both the *Action Modifier* and the *Combat* groups.
* _Expansion_: Group by the expansions in which the cards have been printed.
* _Rarity_: Group the cards by the published rarity.
* _Sect_: Group cards by the Sects listed on the card.
* _Title_: Group cards by the political titles listed on the card.
* _Cost_: Group cards by the cost of the card.
* _Multi Card Type_: Behaves like the _Card Type_ grouping, but treats
multi-type cards as members of separate types. Thus *Action Modifier/Combat*
will appear as a separate group, and cards of that type will not be listed in
the *Action Modifier* and *Combat* groups.

h3(#columns_plugin). Select Extra Columns

By default, Sutekh only shows card names in the White Wolf Card List,
and card names and card counts in other card set lists. You can select
additional columns to display using this plugin. Possible extra columns are:

* _Clans and Creeds:_ Show the Clans or Creeds listed on the card.
* _Group:_ Show the group number for the card.
* _Disciplines and Virtues:_ Show the Disciplines or Virtues listed on the card.
* _Card Type:_ Show the card type.
* _Expansions:_ Show the expansions in which the card has been printed.
* _Capacity or Life (Imbued):_ Show the capacity associated with the card, or
its life, if it is an Imbued crypt card. The life of other ally and retainer
cards is not shown.
* _Sect_: Show the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Show the political titles listed on the card, if it is a crypt card.
Titles listed on library cards will not be shown.
* _Card Text_: Show the text printed on the card.
* _Cost_: Show the cost of the card, together with the cost type.

You can sort the display by a particular column by clicking on the column
header. Click on the same header repeatedly to toggle between ascending and
descending order.

Cards which have equal values within the column selected for sorting are further
sorted by the card name. Because the different cost types aren't comparable, if
you choose to sort by cost, cards will be grouped by cost type first and sorted
within those types.

If you have downloaded the icons from the White Wolf site, you will be able to
toggle the display between the _Show Icons and Names_, _Show Text only_ and
_Show Icons only_ options using the radio buttons provided. This setting will
affect all selected columns that can use icons.

h3(#set_exp_plugin). Set selected cards to a single expansion

This plugin searches for expansions which are common to all the selected cards,
and allows you to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all the
selected cards is set to this choice.

h3(#compare_plugin). Compare with another Card Set

This plugin compares the current card set with a different card set. It displays
which cards are common to both card sets, and lists the unique cards in each
card set.

By default, the plugin ignores the expansions of cards, and considers all
cards with the same name to be the same. You can change this behaviour using the
_Consider Expansions as well_ checkbox when selecting a card set for comparison.

h3(#analyze_plugin). Analyze Deck

This plugin examines a card set and displays various statistics about it which
are intended to give you some indication of how the card set will operate as a
deck.

It displays several tabs, each of which summarises different aspects
of the card set. The first tab summarises some basic information about the
entire set. The second tab implements Legbiter's Happy Family analysis for
the card set. The remaining tabs consider specific card types.

The happy family implementation allows you either to select the number of
disciplines to use, or to select the disciplines to consider manually.

h3(#indep_plugin). Test Card Set Independence

This plugin tests the current card set against other card sets with the same
parent, and considers whether there are enough cards in the parent card set to
simultaneously construct all the selected sets. Multiple decks can be selected
from the list of card sets.

You can test the current card set against all sets with the same parent which
are marked as _In Use_ by checking the _Test against all card sets marked as in use_
checkbox when selecting decks for comparison. This checkbox overrides any
selected entries in the list.

The first tab of the results displays the full list of cards of which there is a
shortage in the parent card set. For each selected set which includes any of
these cards, the list of cards relevant to that set is shown in a separate tab.

h3(#opening_hand_plugin). Simulate Opening Hand

This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended
to give you some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition,
you can generate example opening hands and crypts by clicking the
_Draw sample hand_ button.

h3(#prob_plugin). Card draw probabilities

This plugin displays the probabilities of drawing the selected cards from the
library or the crypt. Unlike the _simulate opening hand_ plugin, this plugin
displays results for longer sequences of card draws.

The first row of the table shows the probabilities of drawing a single card in
the selected list. Sub-rows show the individual probabilities for each possible
combination of selected cards. The second row shows the probabilities of
drawing all possible combinations of two selected cards, etc..

Each probability cell in the table displays two values: the probability of
drawing at least that combination of cards, and the probability of drawing
exactly that combination of cards (shown in brackets).

The plugin has the following settings:

* _columns in table_: Set the number of draws shown in the table. You must
specify a number from one to eight (the default is eight). The first column
shows the probabilities of drawing the given cards in your opening hand or crypt
draw. Subsequent columns show the total probabilities of drawing the cards after
you have drawn the number of extra cards shown in the column header.
* _step between columns_: Set the number of cards drawn between columns. You
must specify a number from one to ten (the default is one).
* _cards of interest_: Set the number of rows in the table. You must specify a
number from one to the total number of cards selected.

The selected changes are only applied when you press the the _recalculate table_
button.

h3(#rulebook_plugin). Rulebook

This plugin allows you to download copies of the rulebook, imbued rules and card
rulings from the White Wolf site, or to install previously downloaded copies.
Once you have downloaded the rulebook files, you can open them in a web browser
using the _Rulebook_ submenu in the _Plugins_ menu on the _Main Window_. To
download the files, or update your existing copies, use the
_Configure Rulebook Plugin_ item in the same submenu.
