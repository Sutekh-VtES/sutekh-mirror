Backend:
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Consider using SQLObject's new .throughTo method for populating / caching
   the objects abstract cards join to.
 * Use sqlobject 0.10's view support to work around mysql's poor subselect
   performance
 * Include general rulings not related to specific cards somewhere.
   Perhaps just put them in the rulings table without any associated cards?

Code Cleanup
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
   - Common base class for the TreeViews?
 * More tests
 * Rename references to PhysicalCardSet to CardSet, and rensure all references
   to AbstractCardSet are gone, except for AbstractCardSetParser
 * Add ways of specifying more limited test data sets
 * Add better persistence of data across tests, to avoid rerunning the 
   parser for each test and improve test runtime
 * Factor out things like the lists of expansions and disciplines in
   SutekhObjects to a seperate file
 * MultiPaneWindow mixes code for handling the widget hopping and application
   code - these should be seperated.

Gui (Functionality):
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Allow easy setting of the expansion when importing cards from file 
 * Convert the repeated functions in the plugins into functions in the plugin 
   API
 * Include traceback in a details section in do_complaint_*.

Gui (Presentation):
 * Cleanup various dialogs, including
   * Unify some of the other dialogs and make various bits more reusable 
     (cf. CreateCardSetDialog hack in plugins)
 * Clean up the card set controller/model/view interactions
   - CardSetManagement stuff is still rather tangled
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Allow colouring options for the cards
 * Add more keyboard shortcuts
 * Disable set_fixed_height_mode on TreeView cells so that the card text extra column
   can be changed to render across multiple lines without breaking layout. This
   will require some other way of dealing with the TreeView jumping bug.
 * Enable setting default grouping, etc. for newly opened card set panes.

Website:
 * Create documentation.
 * Consider switching to Trac. 

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.

Upstream:
 * File GTK bugs for:
   * TreeView jumping.
   * TreeView search pop-up not working under Windows. 

For 0.6:
 * Finish built-in tutorial and help.
