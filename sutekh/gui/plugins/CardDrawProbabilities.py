                   cards from the library or the crypt. Unlike the _simulate
                   opening hand_ tool, this displays results for longer
                   sequences of card draws.

                   The first row of the table shows the probabilities of
                   drawing a single card in the selected list. Sub-rows show
                   the individual probabilities for each possible combination
                   of selected cards. The second row shows the probabilities of
                   drawing all possible combinations of two selected cards,
                   etc..

                   Each probability cell in the table displays two values: the
                   probability of drawing at least that combination of cards,
                   and the probability of drawing exactly that combination of
                   cards (shown in brackets).

                   The tool has the following settings:

                   * _columns in table_: Set the number of draws shown in \
                   the table. You must specify a number from one to eight \
                   (the default is eight). The first column shows the \
                   probabilities of drawing the given cards in your opening \
                   hand or crypt draw. Subsequent columns show the total \
                   probabilities of drawing the cards after you have drawn \
                   the number of extra cards shown in the column header.
                   * _step between columns_: Set the number of cards drawn \
                   between columns. You must specify a number from one to \
                   ten (the default is one).
                   * _cards of interest_: Set the number of rows in the \
                   table. You must specify a number from one to the total \
                   number of cards selected.

                   The selected changes are only applied when you press the
                   the _recalculate table_ button."""
