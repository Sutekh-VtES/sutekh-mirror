h2(#intro). Introduction

If you are new to Sutekh, try reading "The Sutekh Tutorial":Tutorial.html.


h2(#concepts). Important Concepts

Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: _Cards_ and
_Card Sets_.

_Cards_ are the individual cards as described by the official white wolf
card list. Each card describes all the relevant properties of the card,
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest
text for the card.

_Card Sets_ are collections of cards and describe the card and the number of
copies of that card in the collection. An important concept is that card sets
can be related in a parent-child hierarchy. A typical setup is to have a single
card set for the main card collection (usually the *My Collection* card set),
and other card sets, which represent the constructed decks, as children of this
card set, but many other arrangements are possible.


h2(#main). Main Window

The main sutekh window can be split into a number of different panes.

The following panes are supported:

* "The White Wolf card list":#ww
* "The Card Set List":#card_set_list
* "Card Text":#card_text
* "Card Image":#card_image
* "Card Set":#cardsets panes

Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane.
The main window has a menu for global actions.

Panes can be easily rearranged. Dragging a pane onto another pane will swap 
the two panes.

h3(#main_file). File

The file menu has the following options.

* _Import Card Set_: Import a card set from a existing file. The following
file types are supported:
** _Load Card Set from File_: Loads a card set saved in Sutekh's XML file
format.
** _Import CSV File_: "Imports a card set from a comma-separated value
file":#csv_plugin, as produced by a spreadsheet. This allows the columns
for card set, number and expansion to be selected. 
** _Import ARDB or ELDB Card Set_: "Imports a file":#import_plugin
saved by either ARDB and FELDB. Note that the correct type of file must be
specified as well as the file name.
** _Import Card Sets from zip file_: Allows one to select "card sets from a zip
file":#import_zip_plugin to import.
* _Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings_: Update the
database with a new cardlist and/or rulings file. The files can either be
local, or they can be downloaded from the White Wolf website directly. There
may be issues when updating the card list after a new expansion has been
published, discussed in the section
"Refreshing the White Wolf Card List"#refresh
* _Download VTES icons_: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf
website.
* _Preferences_: Manages various preferences.
** _Save Current Pane Set_: Saves the current configuration of the panes. 
** _Save Pane Set on Exit_: Saves the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.
** _Save Exact Pane Positions_: Saves the exact pane positions on exit.
** _Save Window Size_: Save the window size on exit.
* _Restore saved configuration_: Restores the panes to the saved configuration.
* _Quit_: Exit Sutekh

When importing card sets, if Sutekh encounters an unknown card, the
"Card Lookup Window":#lookup is used to identify them.

h3(#main_pane_actions). Pane Actions

This menu allows one to manage the panes in Sutekh.  The _Pane Actions_ menu
has the following options:

* _Equalize pane sizes_: This rearranges the panes so that each pane has the
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.
* _Split current pane horizontally_: This splits the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the
active pane. The two panes of the same height, and half the width of the
pane being split.
* _Split current pane vertically_: This splits the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two
panes of the same width, and half the height of the pane being split. It is not
possible to split panes vertically multiple times.
* _Add New Pane_: This adds a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of
the main window. 
* _Replace Pane_: This opens a submenu, where the currently active pane
can be replaced with any of the available options.
* _Close Pane_: This closes the currently active pane


h3(#main_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the main menu:

* "Backup":#backup_plugin
* "Card Images":#images_plugin


h3(#keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:

One can cycle between different panes using the *&lt;Tab&gt;* key.

The currently active pane can be closed using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W* shortcut.

For panes which support filtering, the filter editing dialog can be activated
using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S* (for specify filter), and the current filter can be
toggled on and off by using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T*.

The *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+* and *&lt;Ctrl&gt;--* shortcuts allow the entire tree displayed in a
pane to either be fully expanded or completely collapsed.

h3(#lookup). Card Lookup Window

There are various reason why Sutekh my fail to correctly identify a card when
importing a card set. Names vary ("Spirit's Touch",
"The Spirit's Touch"), special characters can be missing, and so forth. When
this happens, Sutekh prompts for the correct card.

The card lookup window displays two lists - the list of all white wolf cards
and the list of unknown cards. Below the unknown card list are options
to specify a "filter":#filters and to apply or unapply the filter.

The unknown card list has 2 columns, the name of the unknown card and
the current selection to replace the card, and 3 buttons. The first button
uses the currently selected card from the full white wolf card list to
replace the card, the next marks the card as to be ignored, and the
last applies a filter based on the unknown card name to present a
list of reasonable options.

Once the replacement cards have been selected, the OK button will create the
correct card set.

Choosing cancel in the card lookup dialog will abort the entire import, and
no card set will be created.

If Sutekh cannot identify an expansion in the file, a dialog
will prompt for the correct replacement. If an impossible card
and expansion combination is found in the file, the same card lookup dialog
will be used, except that the expansion as well as the card can be set.


h3(#refresh). Refreshing the White Wolf Card List

This allows Sutekh to update the card list to account for new cards, such
as promos and such. 

Since Sutekh parses the card list published on the white wolf site for
information about the cards, when new expansions are published, Sutekh may
require an update to correctly interpret any changes to the cardlist, such as
new clans or card types. If the expansion does not introduce any significant
changes, Sutekh is able to correctly import the new card list, but may
not interpret the new expansion name correctly. If this happens, Sutekh should
work fine, but, when updating to a new version of Sutekh, one may need to
specify the correct mapping for the expansion when updating the database.

h2(#ww). White Wolf Card List

This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official
white wolf card list. 

h3(#ww_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Show card expansions_: Toggles between showing the card expansions each
card was printed in below the card name in the list.
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggles whether icons are shown for the top
level grouping (when available) are not.
* _Expand All_: Expands all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#ww_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the 
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle between whether the filter is currently applied to the
list or not
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results
of the current filter.

h3(#ww_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the White Wolf Card List pane menu:

* "Cluster Cards":#cluster_plugin
* "Clan Discipline Stats":#stats_plugin
* "Change Grouping":#grouping_plugin
* "Select Extra Columns":#columns_plugin


h2(#card_text). Card Text

The Card Text Pane displays the text on the card, and any ruling that apply
to the card.

This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups,
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.


h2(#card_image). Card Images

If the "Card Image Plugin":#images_plugin has been configured, this pane
will display the appropriate card image for each pane. By default, the
image is resized to fit the pane. By right clicking on the image, this can be changed.
The following options are available:

* _Fit images to the pane_: This is the default
* _Show images at fixed size_: All the images are shown as 225x300 in size.
* _Show images at original size_: All the image are shown at the original size
of the scan.

If there are multiple images for the given card form the different expansions,
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card.
It's possible to cycle through the available expansions by either left clicking
on the image, or using the _Show next expansion image_ and _Show previous
expansion image_ options when right clicking on the frame.


h2(#csv_plugin). Import CSV file

This allows importing card sets stored as a comma-separated file, commonly
produced by spreadsheets. The file must contain a column with card names,
and a column with the card counts, and can optionally contain a column with
the expansions. When importing the file, the mapping between columns and the
contents needs to be specified.

If Sutekh cannot correctly interpret a name or expansion, the 
"Card Lookup Window":#lookup will be used to resolve the situation.

h2(#import_plugin). Import ARDB or ELDB file

This allows one to import files produced by ARDB or FELDB. The file format
is not automatically recognised, so it needs to be manually specified.

For some types of file, such as ARDB inventories, the card set name for the
imported file will need to be specified manually. 

If the name of the card set clashes with an existing name, one will
be asked to rename the imported card set or cancel the import.

If no cards are found in the card set, the card set will not be created.

h2(#import_zip_plugin). Import card sets from zip file

This plugin allows one to select some of the Sutekh Card Sets included
in a zip file (such as those produced by the backup plugin) and import them
into the card set. Unlike the backup plugin, this does not replace any of
the existing card sets.

After selecting the zip file, one will be asked to select the card sets to
import from the list of card sets in the zip file. If any of the card sets
share the same name as an existing card set, one will be asked to either
rename the card set, or skip importing that card set.

For card sets with parents, if the appropriate parent card set can't be found,
the card set will be imported with no parent set.

h2(#card_set_list). Card Set List

This pane lists all the card sets defined. The card sets are arranged so that
child card sets are listed below their parents. 

Card sets can be opened by either double clicking on them, or dragging the card
set name to an existing pane.

The parent of the card set can be changed by dragging the card set name onto
the new parent.

Sets can either be marked as _in use_ or _not in use_. This is intended to
help track which cards are currently available for use in new card sets. 

h3(#card_set_list_actions). Actions

The following actions are available:

* _Create New Card Set_: Creates a new card set.
* _Edit Card Set Properties_: This allows the card set name, author & comment
to be changed, allows the parent of the card set to be changed, and allows
annotations to be added to the card set.
* _Mark/Unmark Card Set as In Use_: Toggles the card set between _in use_
and _not in use_.
* _Delete Card Set_: Deletes the currently selected card set.
* _Expand All_: Expands all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#card_set_list_filter). Filter

The filter menu has two options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card set list. See the 
"Card Set Filters":#card_set_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle between whether the filter is currently applied to the
list or not

h2(#cardsets). Card Sets

h3(#cardsets_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Edit Card Set Properties_: This allows the card set name, author & comment
to be changed, allows the parent of the card set to be changed, and allows
annotations to be added to the card set.
* _Save Card Set to File_: This allows the card set to be saved to Sutekh's
XML format
* _Export Card Set_: This allows the card set to be exported to other file
formats. The Currently supported options are:
** _CSV_: A comma separated format suitable for importing into spreadsheets
** _FELDB file_: Export to a file that can be imported into the FELDB card
manager
** _ARDB XML_: Export to a file that can be imported into the ARDB card manager
** _HTML_: Export to a nice HTML file, similar to that produced by ARDB
** _ARDB Text_: Export to a text file, similar to that produced by ARDB
* _Cards To Show_: This sets which cards are displayed. The options are:
** _This Set Only_: Show only the cards in this card set.
** _Show All Cards_: Show all the cards in the WW list. Cards not in this card
set will have a count of 0
** _Show all cards in parent card set_: Show all the cards in this card set as
well as any cards in the parent card set that are not in this card set.
** _Show all cards in child card sets_: Show all the cards in this card set as
well as any cards in those child card sets marked as _In Use_ that are not in
this card set.
* _Display Mode_: Controls which additional information is displayed below the
card names in the tree. The options are:
** _Show No Children_: Nothing is displayed below the card name
** _Show Expansions_: Show the card counts for each expansion specified
** _Show Child Card Sets_: Show the counts for those child card sets marked as
_In Use_
** _Show Expansions + Child Card Sets_: Show the expansions counts, and below
them, show the child card sets marked _In Use_
** _Show Child Card Set and Expansions_: Show the child card sets and, below
them, show the expansion information.
* _Parent Count Mode_: For card sets with a parent set, this controls how the
_Parent count_ column is displayed. The options are:
** _Don't show parent card counts_: Hide the parent count column
** _Show parent count_: Just show the parent count. If the count for this
card set exceeds the parent count, this number is shown in red.
** _Show difference between parent count and this card set_: Displays the
difference between the parent card count and this card set. If this number
is negative, it is shown in red.
** _Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use_: Show difference
between parent count and all total amongst all the card sets marked in use. If
this number is negative, it is shown in red. 
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggles whether icons are shown for the top
level grouping (when available) are not.
* _Expand All_: Expands all the items in the tree.  
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.
* _Delete Card Set_: Delete the card set from the database.
* _Print Card Set_: Print the card set.

h3(#cardsets_edit). Edit

This menu has the following options:

* _Card Set is Editable_: This toggles the card set between being editable
and not editable. When the card set is not editable, it's not possible
to add or delete card from the set directly.
* _Copy selection_: This copies the currently selected set of cards into the
buffer. This can be pasted into an editable card set to add the selected cards
there.
* _Paste_: Paste the previously copied selection into the current card set.
This option is only available when the card set is editable.
* _Delete selection_: This deletes the selected cards from the card set. This
is only possible when the card set is editable.

If the card set is not editable, changes cannot be made to the contents
directly. It is still possible to change the card set contents by
editing the parent card set when the _Display Mode_ -> _Show Child Card Sets_
option is active.

h3(#cardsets_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the 
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle between whether the filter is currently applied to the
list or not
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results
of the current filter.

h3(#cardsets_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the card set pane plugins menu:

* "Cluster Cards":#cluster_plugin
* "Clan Discipline Stats":#stats_plugin
* "Change Grouping":#grouping_plugin
* "Select Extra Columns":#columns_plugin
* "Set selected cards to a single expansion":#set_exp_plugin
* "Compare card set with another Card Set":#compare_plugin
* "Analyze Deck":#analyze_plugin
* "Test Card Set Independence":#indep_plugin
* "Simulate Opening Hand":#opening_hand_plugin
* "Card draw probabilities":#prob_plugin
 

h3(#cardsets_keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist.

The editable state of the card set can be toggled using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E*.

The current selection can be copied to the clipboard using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C*

If the card set is editable, the current selection can be deleted using *&lt;Del&gt;*
or pasted into the card set using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V*

For an editable card set, the card number for the entire selection can be set
in the range 1 to 9 directly by entering the number directly, or all the number
for all cards in the selection can either be incremented or decremented by
1 using either *+* or *-* respectively. If the card set is not editable, these
keys have no effect.


h2(#filters). Filters

Filtering is one of the central activities in Sutekh. Complex queries can
be constructed by combining the various basic filters. 

The Filter dialog will display the last used filter for the given pane. This
filter can then be modified or the filter can be cleared using the
_Clear Filter_ button.

Complex filters can be saved for later reuse using the _Save_ button, and
recalled using the _Load_ button. When modifying a filter, it can be reverted
to saved version using the _Revert Filter_ button.

h3(#card_filters). Card Filters

These filters apply to either the white wolf card list or a card set. The
following basic filters are supported:

* _Card Type_:
* _Cost Type_: Filters on the type of cost (blood, pool, and so forth). This
takes a list of types to match, and is matches if the cost type matches any
in the list. This does not consider the cost, just the cost type.
* _Clan_:
* _Discipline_:
* _Group_:
* _Capacity_: Filter on the capacity listed on the card.
* _Cost_: Filter on the cost of the card. This filter takes a list of costs
to match, and matches in the card cost matches any entry in the list. Note that
this does not consider the cost type. To filter only on costs of a specific
type, this needs to be combined with the _Cost Type_ filter.
* _Life (Crypt)_:
* _Creed_:
* _Virtue_:
* _Card Text_:
* _Card Name_:
* _Sect_:
* _Title_:
* _Expansion_with_Rarity_:
* _Discipline with Level_:
* _Physical Expansion_:
* _Card Sets_:
* _In Card Sets In Use_:
* _Card Count_:
* _Card Function_:
* _Sub-Filter_: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

These filters are also available in the "Card Lookup Window":#lookup when
importing card sets, to help find unknown cards.

Currently, the only way to filter on properties of a merged vampire, such as
different discipline levels, is to filter on the card text.

h3(#card_set_filters). Card Set Filters

These filters apply to the card set list. The following basic filters are
supported.

* _Card Set Name_: This matches the name of the card set. Like the Card Name
or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial string to search for, and
% and _ can be used as wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Description_: This matches the description of the card set.
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial string to
search for, and % and _ can be used as wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Author_: This matches the description of the card set.
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial string to
search for, and % and _ can be used as wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Annotations_: This matches the annotations of the card set.
Like the Card Name or Card Text filters, it is treated as a partial string to
search for, and % and _ can be used as wildcard characters.
* _Parent Card Set_: This takes as input a list of card sets, and
matches those card sets whose parent card set is in the list.
* _Card Set Marked as in Use_: This matches all card sets for which are marked
as being *In Use*.
* _Sub-Filter_: Nest an additional filter box inside the current box. See
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

Since the card sets can be part of a hierarchy of parents and children, if a
child card set matches the filter, it will be displayed along with it's 
parents. If a parent card set matches the filter, only those children that
also match the filter will be displayed.

h3(#combining). Combining Basic Filters

Sutekh combines filters using filter boxes to group the basic filters
together.

There are 4 types of filter box, namely:

* _All of_: This filter matches only in every filter in the box matches.
* _Any of_: This filter matches if at least of the filters in the box matches.
* _Not all of_: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the box
doesn't match. 
* _Not any of_: This filter matches only if every filter in the box doesn't
match.

Each filter boxes can also contain sub-filters, which are themselves
filter boxes. Thus complex queries can be constructed by nesting multiple
filter boxes.

h2(#plugins). Plugin List

h3(#backup_plugin). Backup

This allows one to either save or restore a full backup of the current
database. The backup will be saved as a zip file and is independent of the
database back end Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used to
transfer the complete state between different databases.

There are two options offered by the plugin:

* _Save a Full Backup_
* _Restore a Full Backup_

_Save a Full Backup_ will save the current state (card sets and their contents)
to the specified zip file. _Restore a Full Backup_ will import all the card sets
from the backup. Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently
in the database with the contents of the backup.

Backups can be saved at any time. Various actions, such as updating the WW
card list, will also allow a backup to be saved.

h3(#images_plugin). Card Images

This plugin allows configuring the card images pane. 

The image can be configured in three ways.

* _Download and install cardimages from feldb.extra.hu_: This attempts to
download the images form the FELDB website, and makes them available to
Sutekh. The zip file is quite large, so this option may take some time.
* _Install images from a local zip file_: If a zip file containing the
images is available, Sutekh can install directly from this zipfile.
* _Choose a directory containing the images_: If the images have already been
installed for some other reason (such as an existing ARDB or FELDB
installation), then this option can be used to configure Sutekh to reuse that
installation.


h3(#cluster_plugin). Cluster Cards

h3(#stats_plugin). Clan Discipline Stats

This plugin shows an analysis of all the difference clans in the white wolf
card list. For each clan, the number of vampires in each clan, the sum of the
vampire capacities are the most common disciplines are shown. The 
score for the discipline, and various stats about how the disciplines are
distributed are also shown.

The tree view can be expanded to show the details for each legal grouping
combination.

The score is intended to give some indication of how common superior
disciplines are. Vampires without the discipline score 0 for that
discipline, vampires with the inferior discipline score 1 and vampires
with the superior discipline score 2.

h3(#grouping_plugin). Change Grouping

By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types. The grouping
used can be changed via this menu option.

The following groupings are available:

* _Clans and Creeds_: Group cards by the either clan or the creed associated
with the card. This treats the Imbued Creeds as if they were Vampire Clans.
* _Disciplines and Virtues_: Group cards by the either the disciplines or the
virtues on the card. This treats the Imbued Virtues as if they were Vampire
Disciplines.
* _Crypt or Library_: Split the card list into crypt and library cards
* _Card Type_: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping
treats multi-type cards, such as _"Action Modifier/Combat"_ cards as belonging
to both the _"Action Modifier"_ and the _"Combat"_ groups.
* _Expansion_: Group by the expansions the cards have been printed in
* _Rarity_: Group the cards by the published rarity.
* _Sect_: Group cards by the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Group cards by the political title on the card.
* _Cost_: Group cards by the cost on the card.
* _Multi Card Type_: Like the _Card Type_ grouping, except this treats
multi-type cards as separate types. Thus _"Action Modifier/Combat"_ will
appear as a separate group, and the cards will not be listed in either the
_"Action Modifier"_ or _"Combat"_ groups.

h3(#columns_plugin). Select Extra Columns

By default, sutekh only shows the card name for the White Wolf Card List,
and the number and card name for the card set lists. Additional columns
to display can be selected using this plugin. The extra columns are:

* _Clans and Creeds:_ Also display the clans or creeds associated with the
card.
* _Group:_ Show the group number for the card.
* _Disciplines and Virtues:_ Show the Disciplines and Virtues associated with
the card.
* _Card Type:_ Also show the card type.
* _Expansions:_ Show the expansions this card has been printed in.
* _Capacity or Life(Imbued):_ Show the capacity associated with this card, or
the life for the Imbued crypt cards. Ally & retainer life is not shown.
* _Sect_: Show the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Show the political title possessed by the vampire card.
* _Card Text_: Show the text printed on the card.
* _Cost_: Show the cost of the card.

The display can be sorted by according to these columns, by clicking on the 
column header. When cards have equal values, they are sorted by the card name.
Because the different cost types aren't comparable, the
cost column groups each distinct cost type together and sorts within the
cost types.

If the icons have been downloaded from the white wolf site, then for the
appropriate columns, the display can be toggled between the
_Show Icons and Names_, _Show Text only_, _Show Icons only_ using the radio
buttons. This option will affect all the selected columns that can use icons.

h3(#set_exp_plugin). Set selected cards to a single expansion

This searches for the common expansions between all the selected cards, and
allows the user to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all
the selected cards is set to this common choice. 

h3(#compare_plugin). Compare card set with another Card Set

This plugin compares the current card set to a different card set, and displays
which cards are common to the card sets, and, for each card set, lists the
unique cards.

By default, the plugin ignores the expansions for cards, and considers all
cards of the same name as the same, but this behaviour can be changed using the
_Consider Expansions as well_ checkbox when selecting the card set to compare
to.

h3(#analyze_plugin). Analyze Deck

This plugin examines a plugin and displays various statistics about it that
are intended to give some indication of how the card set will operate as a
deck.

Several tabs are displayed, where each tab summarises different aspects
of the card set. The first tab summarises some basic information about the
entire set. The second tab implements Legbiter's Happy Family analysis for
the card set. Subsequent panes consider specific card types.

The happy family implementation allows one to either select the number of
disciplines to use, or to select the disciplines to consider manually.

h3(#indep_plugin). Test Card Set Independence

This tests the current card set against other card sets with the same parent,
and considers there are enough cards in the parent card set to simultaneously
construct all the selected sets. Multiple decks can be selected from the list
of card sets.

The current card set can be tested against all the sets with the same
parent marked as in use using the _Test against all card sets marked as in use_
check box when selecting decks to compare against. This check box overrides
any selected entries from the list.

The results list all the cards missing from the parent card set, and, for
each set which includes the missing cards, the cards for that set are listed.

h3(#opening_hand_plugin). Simulate Opening Hand

This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended
to give some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition,
the plugin can generate example opening hands and crypts via the _Draw sample
hand_ button. 

h3(#prob_plugin). Card draw probabilities

This plugin displays the probability of drawing the selected cards from either
the library or the crypt. Unlike the _simulate opening hand_ plugin, this
plugin displays results for longer sequences of drawing cards.

The plugin has the following settings which can be used to change the results.

* _columns in table_: This sets the number of draws the columns with
probabilities shown in the table and can range from 1 to 8. The first column
is always the probably for the opening hand or crypt draw. Subsequent columns
are the total probability after also drawing the number of extra cards shown in
the column header.
* _step between columns_: This sets the number of cards drawn between columns
and ranges from 1 to 10 (defaulting to 1). Each subsequent column after the
first of the table shows the probabilities after drawing this number of
additional cards.
* _cards of interest_: This sets the number of rows in the table, and can
range from 1 to the total number of cards selected.

The selected changes are only applied when the _recalculate table_ button is
pressed.

h3(#rulebook_plugin). Rulebook

This plugin allows downloading copies of the rulebook, imbued rules and card
rulings from the White Wolf site or installing previously downloaded copies.
Once downloaded, the rulebook files may be opened in a web browser using the
_Rulebook_ submenu in the _Plugins_ menu on the _Main Window_. To
download the files, or update the existing copies, use the
_Configure Rulebook Plugin_ item in the same submenu.
