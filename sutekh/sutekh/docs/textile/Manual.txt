h2(#intro). Introduction

If you are new to Sutekh, try reading "The Sutekh Tutorial":Tutorial.html.


h2(#concepts). Important Concepts

Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: _Cards_ and
_Card Sets_.

_Cards_ are the individual cards as described by the official White Wolf
card list. Sutekh describes all the relevant properties of each card,
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest
card text.

You can set the expansion to which each specific card belongs. This
allows you to distinguish between multiple copies of the same card from
different expansions. If the expansion is not set, Sutekh notes this as
*Unknown Expansion* in the card set view.

_Card Sets_ are collections of cards, and describe each card and the number of
copies of that card in the collection. Card sets can be related in a
parent-child hierarchy. In a typical setup, there is a single card set for the
main card collection (usually the *My Collection* card set); and other card
sets, which represent constructed decks, are children of this card set -- but
many other arrangements are possible.


h2(#main). Main Window

You can split the main Sutekh window into a number of different panes.

The following panes are supported:

* "The White Wolf card list":#ww
* "The Card Set List":#card_set_list
* "Card Text":#card_text
* "Card Image":#card_image
* "Card Set":#cardsets panes

Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane.
The main window has a menu for global actions.

You can easily rearrange panes. You can swap two panes by dragging one onto the
other. For most panes, this can be done from any section that won't start
another drag operation (such as dragging cards), but, so that it is possible
to easily select and copy card text, the card text pane can only be dragged by
using the pane title.

h3(#main_file). File

The file menu has the following options.

* _Backup_: Save or restore backups of the database, discussed further in the \
"Backup":#backup section.
* _Import Card Set_: Import a card set from a existing file. The following \
file types are supported:
** _Load Card Set from File_: Load a card set saved in Sutekh's XML file \
format.
** _Import CSV File_: \
"Import a card set from a comma-separated value file":#import_csv, as \
produced by a spreadsheet. You can select the columns for card set, number \
and expansion.
** _Import ARDB or ELDB Card Set_: "Import a file":#import_ardb \
saved by either ARDB or FELDB. You may specify the correct type of file as \
well as the file name.
** _Import Card Sets from zip file_: Select \
"card sets from a zip file":#import_zip to import.
* _Data Downloads_: This submenu allows you to update data from the various \
external sources Sutekh uses.
** _Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings_: Update the \
database with a new cardlist and/or rulings file. You can either specify \
local files, or opt to download them from the appropriate websites directly. \
Sutekh may encounter problems when updating the card list after a new \
expansion has been published -- this is discussed further in the section \
"Refreshing the White Wolf Card List":#refresh.
** _Download VTES icons_: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf \
website.
** _Download starter decks_: Download and import a list of the White Wolf \
preconstructed decks from the sutekh wiki. The zip file also includes the \
details of the storyline and demo decks released by WW, but these can be \
excluded using the checkboxes. If you have not imported the details of \
these extra cards (see "Refreshing the White Wolf Card List":#refresh), \
these will be greyed out and automaticaly excluded.
** _Download or Configure Card Images_: Download images of the cards for the \
"Card Images":#card_image pane, or use an existing zip file or directory of \
images.
** _Download Rulebook Files_: Download the various files for the \
"Rulebook":#rulebook menu.
* _Preferences_: Manage various preferences.
** _Use "path of ..., the" name display_: If selected, card names prefixed \
with "The", "An" or "A" are displayed and sorted with the prefix at the end.
** _Save Pane Set on Exit_: Save the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.
** _Save Exact Pane Positions_: Save the exact pane positions on exit.
** _Save Window Size_: Save the window size on exit.
** _Show Starter Information_: If the starter decks have been downloaded \
into the database, this will add a list the starter decks a card has been \
published in to the "Card Text":#card_text pane when the card is selected.
** _Export to HTML preferences_: Set the destination for the links created \
in the exported HTML files.
* _Manage Profiles_: Bring up the "profile management dialog":#manage_profiles \
to edit or delete the various pane profiles
* _Save Current Pane Set_: Save the current configuration of the panes.
* _Restore saved configuration_: Restore the panes to the saved configuration.
* _Quit_: Exit Sutekh.

If Sutekh encounters an unknown card when importing card sets, it will prompt
you to identify it using the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup.

h4(#backup). Backup

This allows you either to save or to restore a full backup of the current
database. The backup is saved as a zip file, and is independent of the
database back-end which Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used
to transfer the complete state between different databases.

There are two options offered:

* _Save a Full Backup_: Save the current state (card sets and their contents) \
to the specified zip file.
* _Restore a Full Backup_: Import all the card sets from the specified zip \
file. Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently in the \
database with the contents of the backup.

You can save a backup at any time. Sutekh will ask you whether you would like to
save a backup when you initiate certain actions, such as updating the White Wolf
card list.

h4(#import_csv). Import CSV file

This allows you to import card sets stored as a comma-separated file, a format
commonly produced by spreadsheets. The file must contain a column with card
names and a column with card counts, and can optionally contain a column with
expansions. When you importing the file, you must specify the mapping between
the columns and their contents.

If Sutekh cannot correctly interpret a name or expansion, it will prompt you to
resolve the situation using the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup.

h4(#import_ardb). Import ARDB or ELDB file

This allows you to import files produced by ARDB, JOL, Lackey CCG or FELDB.
While Sutekh will attempt to identify the file format automatically, this isn't
always reliable, so you have the option of specifying the format manually.

For some types of file, such as ARDB inventories, you will also need to specify
a card set name for the imported file.

If the name of the card set clashes with an existing name, you will
be asked to rename the imported card set or cancel the import.

If no cards are found in the card set, the card set will not be created.

h4(#import_zip). Import card sets from zip file

This option allows you to select some or all of the Sutekh Card Sets included
in a zip file (such as those produced by backups) and import them into the card
set. Unlike restoring a backup, this does not replace any existing card sets
automatically.

After selecting the zip file, you will be asked to select the card sets to
import from the list of card sets in the zip file. If any of the card sets share
the same name as an existing card set, you will be asked either to rename the
card set, or skip importing that card set.

If a card set to be imported has a parent card set, and that set cannot be
found, the card set will be imported with no parent set.



h3(#main_pane_actions). Pane Actions

This menu allows you to manage the panes in Sutekh. The _Pane Actions_ menu
has the following options:

* _Equalize pane sizes_: Rearrange the panes so that each pane has the \
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height. \
Pane equalizing may also be triggered using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-p* shortcut.
* _Split current pane horizontally_: Split the currently active pane \
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the \
active pane. The two panes will be the same height as, and half the width of \
the pane being split.
* _Split current pane vertically_: Split the currently active pane \
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The \
two panes will be the same width as, and half the height of the pane being \
split. It is not possible to split panes vertically multiple times.
* _Add New Pane_: Add a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of \
the main window.
* _Replace Pane_: Replace the currently active pane with another. The \
available options will be presented in a submenu.
* _Close Pane_: Close the currently active pane.


h3(#rulebook). Rulebook

Once you have downloaded the rulebook files, you
can open them in a web browser using the _Rulebook_ menu.

The available files are copies of the rulebook, the rules reference, the V:EKN
tournament rules, imbued rules and card rulings from the White Wolf site and
the VTES and Imbued FAQ's hosted on www.thelasombra.com.

To download the files, or update your existing copies, use the _Download
Rulebook Files_ item in the _Data Downloads_ submenu.


h3(#keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:

You can cycle between different panes using the *&lt;Tab&gt;* key.

You can close the currently active pane using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W* shortcut.

In panes which support filtering, you can activate the filter editing dialog
using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S* (for "*S*pecify filter"), and toggle the current filter
on and off using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T*.

The *&lt;Ctrl&gt;--+* and *&lt;Ctrl&gt;---* shortcuts allow you to expand fully or
collapse completely the entire tree displayed in a pane.


h3(#minimize_panes). Minimizing Panes

Double-clicking on a pane title will minimize the pane to a toolbar below the
main menu. The toolbar is hidden if no frames are currently minimized. Clicking
on a pane listed on the toolbar will unminimize it and place to the right of
current set of open panes.


h3(#refresh). Refreshing the White Wolf Card List

This allows Sutekh to update the card list to account for new cards, such
as promos.

Sutekh parses the card list published on the V:EKN site for
information about the cards. When new expansions are published, Sutekh may
require an update to interpret major changes to the cardlist, such as
new clans or card types. If the expansion does not introduce any significant
changes, Sutekh may be able to import the new card list correctly, but may be
unable to interpret the new expansion name. If this happens, Sutekh should
continue working, but you may need to specify the correct mapping for the
expansion when updating the database during your next upgrade.

The _Storyline Card File_ provides information not included in the official
V:EKN card list. This includes information about the various special storyline
cards that have been printed, and also details various special expansions,
such as those for the demonstration decks, that have been released.

h2(#ww). White Wolf Card List

This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official
White Wolf card list.

h3(#ww_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Show card expansions_: Toggle display of the card expansions in which \
each card was printed below the card name in the list.
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggle whether icons are shown for the top \
level grouping (when available).
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#ww_edit). Edit

* _Copy selection_: Copy the currently selected set of cards into the buffer. \
You can paste this into an editable card set to add the selected cards to it.
* _Search_: Open up a "search":#searchdialog dialog which will search the list \
for a card with a name starting with the typed text. The search dialog can \
also be opened by either using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F* shortcut, or by simply \
starting to type in the list view.

h3(#ww_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the \
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the list.
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results \
of the current filter. The new card set will be opened automatically and \
will be set editable.

h3(#ww_analyze). Analyze

The following analysis options are available for White Wolf Card List:

* "Clan Discipline Stats":#stats
* "Expansion Stats":#exp_stats
* "Cluster Cards":#cluster

h2(#card_text). Card Text

The Card Text Pane displays the text on the card, and any rulings that apply
to the card.

This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups,
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.


h2(#card_image). Card Images

If the card images have been installed, this pane will display the appropriate
card image for each pane. By default, all images are resized to fit the pane.
You can change this setting by right-clicking on the image.

The following options are available:

* _Fit images to the pane_: All images are resized to fit the pane.
* _Show images at fixed size_: All images are resized to 225x300 pixels.
* _Show images at original size_: All images are shown at the original size \
of the scan.

If there are multiple images for the given card from the different expansions,
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card.
You can cycle through the available expansions either by left-clicking
on the image, or by selecting the _Show next expansion image_ and
_Show previous expansion image_ options after right-clicking on the frame.

h2(#card_set_list). Card Set List

This pane lists all the card sets which have been defined. The card sets are
arranged so that child card sets are listed below their parents.

You can open a card set either by double-clicking on its name, or by dragging
the name to an existing pane.

You can change the parent of a card set by dragging the card set name onto the
new parent's name.

You can mark sets either as _in use_ or _not in use_. This is intended to
help you track which cards are currently available for you to use in new card
sets.

It's possible to open multiple copies of a given card set.

h3(#card_set_list_actions). Actions

The following actions are available:

* _Create New Card Set_: Create a new card set. The new card set will be \
opened in a new pane, and will be set to be editable.
* _Edit Card Set Properties_: Change the card set name, author and \
description, change the parent of the card set, or add annotations to the \
card set.
* _Mark/Unmark Card Set as In Use_: Toggle whether the card set is _in use_ \
or _not in use_.
* _Delete Card Set_: Delete the currently selected card set.
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.

h3(#card_set_list_edit). Edit

* _Search_: Open up a "search":#searchdialog dialog which will search the \
list for a card set with a name starting with the typed text. The search \
dialog can also be opened by either using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F* shortcut, or \
by simply starting to type in the list view.
* _Edit Profiles_: Open up a "edit":#edit_profile profile dialog for \
adding or changing profiles for the card set list.
* _CardSet List Profile_: Allows you to select between the available \
profiles for the card set list.

h3(#card_set_list_filter). Filter

The filter menu has two options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card set list. See the \
"Card Set Filters":#card_set_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the list.

h2(#cardsets). Card Sets

This pane lists the contents of a specific card set.

The display has several columns. A column for the number of cards,
a column for the number of cards in the parent card set (the
*parent count column*) and a column for the card name. Extra columns can
be enabled as well.

By default, the card set is sorted on the card name, but it can be sorted
by any of the columns.

The parent card column is hidden, and cannot be enabled, if the card set
has no parent. By default, the parent count column is hidden if the parent
card set is empty, but it can be shown.

h3(#cardsets_actions). Actions

The Actions menu allows the following actions:

* _Edit Card Set Properties_: Change the card set name, author and \
description, change the parent of the card set, or add annotations to the \
card set.
* _Save Card Set to File_: Save the card set to Sutekh's XML format.
* _Export Card Set_: Export the card set to other file formats. The currently \
supported options are:
** _CSV_: A comma-separated format suitable for importing into spreadsheets
** _FELDB file_: A file that can be imported into the FELDB card \
manager
** _ARDB XML_: A file that can be imported into the ARDB card manager
** _HTML_: A nice HTML file, similar to that produced by ARDB
** _ARDB Text_: A text file, similar to that produced by ARDB
** _V:EKN Forum_: A version formatted for the V:EKN forums at vekn.net
** _JOL_: A text file that can be pasted into the Jyhad Online deck \
builder
** _Lackey CCG_: A text file that can be imported into the Lackey CCG client
* _Expand All_: Expand all the items in the tree.
* _Collapse All_: Collapse the tree as far as possible.
* _Delete Card Set_: Delete the card set from the database.
* _Print Card Set_: Print the card set.
* _Display Card Set in alternative format_: Show the card set in some of the \
formats available via _Export Card Set_. This is useful for copying and \
pasting the deck into a web browser and so forth.


h3(#cardsets_edit). Edit

This menu has the following options:

* _Card Set is Editable_: Toggle whether the card set is editable. When the \
card set is not editable, you may not add cards to the set or delete cards \
from the set directly.
* _Copy selection_: Copy the currently selected set of cards into the \
buffer.  You can paste this into an editable card set to add the selected \
cards to it.
* _Paste_: Paste the previously copied selection into the current card set. \
This option is only available when the card set is editable.
* _Delete selection_: Delete the selected cards from the card set. This \
is only possible when the card set is editable. The deleted selection is \
not placed in the buffer.
* _Search_: Open up a "search":#searchdialog dialog which will search the \
list for a card with a name starting with the typed text. The search dialog \
can also be opened by either using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F* shortcut, or by \
simply starting to type in the list view.
* _Set selected cards to a single expansion_: This searches for expansions \
which are common to all the selected cards, and allows you to choose one of \
these. The physical expansion for all the selected cards is set to this \
choice.
* _Take a snapshot of this card set_: This creates a copy of the current \
state of the card set, and appends the current date and time to the name. \
The newly created card set is a child of the current card set.

If the card set is not editable, you cannot make changes to its contents
directly. It is still possible for you to change the card set contents by
editing the parent card set when the _Display Mode_ -> _Show Child Card Sets_
option is active.

h3(#cardsets_filter). Filter

The filter menu has three options:

* _Specify Filter_: Specify the filter to apply to the card list. See the \
"Card Filters":#card_filters section.
* _Apply Filter_: Toggle whether the filter is currently applied to the list.
* _Create Card Set From Filter_: Create a new card set containing the results \
of the current filter. The new card set will be opened automatically and \
will be set editable.

When editing a card set, the display is always updated according to the active
filter (i.e. if the filter is being applied). This does mean that, when adding
cards to a card set when a filter is active, not all the new cards may be
displayed, and, when using a filter that includes the card count, cards may
appear and disappear due to the changing counts.

Since complex filters may be expensive to evaluate, editing card sets with
a filter active will be slow in some cases.

h3(#cardsets_analyze). Analyze

The following analysis options are available for card sets:

* "Analyze Deck":#analyze_deck
* "Card draw probabilities":#draw_prob
* "Cluster Cards":#cluster
* "Compare with another Card Set":#compare
* "Simulate Opening Hand":#opening_hand
* "Test Card Set Independence":#test_indep

h3(#cardsets_keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist:

You can toggle the editable state of the card set using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E*.

You can copy the current selection to the clipboard using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C*.

If the card set is editable, you can delete the current selection using
*&lt;Del&gt;* or paste a copied selection into the card set using
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V*.

In an editable card set, you can set the count for all the cards in a selection
to a number from one to ten by typing the number directly. You can increment
and decrement the count for all the cards in a selection using *+* and *-*. If
the card set is not editable, these keys have no effect.

h2(#dialogs). Other Dialogs

h3(#lookup). Card Lookup Dialog

For various reasons, Sutekh may fail to identify a card correctly when
importing a card set. Names vary ("Spirit's Touch",
"The Spirit's Touch"), special characters can be missing, etc.. When
this happens, Sutekh will prompt you for the correct card.

The card lookup window displays two lists: the list of all White Wolf cards
and the list of unknown cards. Below the unknown card list are options
to specify a "filter":#filters, to apply or unapply the filter, to show or
hide cards not legal for tournament play or to "search":#searchdialog the card
list.

The unknown card list has two columns -- the name of the unknown card and
the currently selected replacement from the White Wolf card list -- and three
buttons. Use the first button to replace the card with the currently selected
card, the second button to mark the card as ignored, and the last to view a list
of reasonable options (Sutekh finds these by applying a filter based on the
unknown card name).

Once you have selected replacements for all unknown cards (or chosen to ignore
them), use the OK button to create the card set.

If you choose to cancel, the entire import will be aborted and no card set will
be created.

If Sutekh cannot identify an expansion in the file, it will prompt you for the
correct replacement. If Sutekh finds an impossible card and expansion
combination, it will prompt you to resolve the situation using the card lookup
dialog -- but you will have the opportunity to select both the card and the
expansion.

h3(#searchdialog). Search Dialog

The search dialog can be used to find specific cards or card sets quickly.

In the main window, it can be popped up by using the menu item, the
*&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F* shortcut, or by starting to type in the window directly.

In the card lookup window, it can be popped up by using the search button,
the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F*  shortcut, or by starting to type.

The dialog can be hidden by either pressing the *Escape* key, the *Enter* key,
or by clicking outside the search dialog. Note that, to prevent unexpected
side-effects, while the search dialog is shown, clicking will only hide
the dialog and not effect any else.

The search looks to match names starting with the typed text. When multiple
cards match, you can easily move between them by using the up or down keys
while the search dialog is visible.


h2(#filters). Filters

Filtering is one of the most common activities in Sutekh. You can construct
complex queries by "combining":#combining various basic filters.

The Filter dialog will display the last used filter for the given pane. You can
clear or modify this filter using the _Clear Filter_ button.

You can save complex filters for later reuse using the _Save_ button, and recall
them using the _Load_ button. When modifying a filter, you can revert to the
saved version using the _Revert Filter_ button. A saved filter will include
all values currently set for the filter.

h3(#filter_dialog). The Filter Dialog

The filter dialog is laid out with 3 panes. The central pane shows the current
filter, with any values that have been set so far.

The left hand pane lists all the different possible filter types. Individual
filter elements can be dragged from this into the central filter pane, and the
filter elements can be re-arranged within the central pane as well. This
is mostly useful when using multiple filter groups (see
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining).

When a filter element is selected, the right hand pane allows for the values
for that filter element to be selected. This also provides buttons to delete
filter elements or values, negate the meaning of the filter element and to
temporarily disable filter elements.  Disabled filter elements are not used in
the filter, but the values set for the element are preserved. These options are
also available from a *Right-Click* context menu.

The buttons also have associated keyboard accelerators. Pressing *&lt;Del&gt;*
will delete the current filter element, *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;space&gt;* will
disable the current filter element and *&lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;space&gt;* will negate
the filter element. *&lt;Tab&gt;* can be used to move between the different
elements in the filter dialog. It's possible to switch between the two panes
(and the filter list elements in a pane) using &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;left&gt; and
&lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;right&gt;.

Filter values can be dragged from the right-hand pane into any filter of the
same type. Filter values can also be dragged between filters of the same
type.

The currently selected set of values in the right-hand pane can be pasted into
the currently selected filter element using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Enter&gt;*.

Filters and filter values can be removed from the filter by using the
buttons, using the context menu, or by dragging filter elements from the
left hand pane to the right hand pane.

h3(#card_filters). Card Filters

These filters apply either to the White Wolf card list or a card set. The
following basic filters are supported:

* _Card Type_: Filter on the type of card. You must specify a "list":#list of \
card types. A card matches if any one of its types matches any type in the \
list.
* _Cost Type_: Filter on the type of cost which must be paid for the card. \
You must specify a "list":#list of cost types. The filter ignores the \
numerical cost, and considers only the cost type. If you wish to filter on \
a specific cost and cost type, you must combine this filter with the _Cost_ \
filter.  Presently, the recognised types of cost are pool, blood and \
conviction, and this filter matches only library cards. Vampire capacity and \
ally/retainer life are not considered to be cost types.
* _Clan_: Filter on the clan(s) listed on the card. You must specify a  \
"list":#list of clans. A card matches if any clan listed on the card matches \
any clan in the list.
* _Discipline_: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card. You must \
specify a "list":#list of disciplines. A card matches if any discipline \
listed on the card matches any discipline in the list. This filter ignores \
discipline levels.
* _Group_: Filter on the group of a crypt card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of groups. A card matches if its group matches any group in the \
list.
* _Capacity_: Filter on the capacity listed on the card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of capacities. A card matches if its capacity matches any \
capacity in the list.
* _Cost_: Filter on the cost which must be paid for the card. You must \
specify a "list":#list of costs. A card matches if its cost matches any cost \
in the list numerically. This filter ignores the cost type, and considers \
only the numerical cost. If you wish to filter on a specific cost and cost \
type, you must combine this filter with the _Cost Type_ filter (see \
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining). Note that cards without a cost are \
considered not to have a cost type either, so filtering for a cost of 0 and \
a cost type will fail to match any cards.
* _Life_: Filter on the life value of a card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of life values. A card matches if the life value listed on the \
card matches any life value in the list. This filter matches crypt cards \
which have a life value (such as the Imbued), and match library cards which \
have a life value (other allies, and retainers). For allies and retainers \
this matches only the base life if the life varies with discipline level.
* _Creed_: Filter on the creed(s) listed on the card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of creeds. A card matches if any creed listed on the card \
matches any creed in the list.
* _Virtue_: Filter on the virtue(s) listed on the card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of virtues. A card matches if any virtue listed on the card \
matches any virtue in the list.
* _Card Text_: Filter on the text of the card. You must specify a \
"string":#string. A card matches if the string appears in the card text. This \
filter ignores the card name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard \
characters.
* _Card Name_: Filter on the name of the card. You must specify a \
"string":#string. A card matches if the string appears in the card name. You \
can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Sect_: Filter on the sect(s) listed on the card. You must specify a \
"list":#list of sects. A card matches if any sect listed on the card matches \
any sect in the list.
* _Title_: Filter on the vampire title(s) listed on the card. You must \
specify a "list":#list of titles. A card matches if any title listed on the \
card matches any title in the list.
* _Keyword_: Filter on keywords associated with the card. You must specify \
a "list":#list of keywords. A card matches if any keyword connected with \
the card matches any keyword in the list.
* _Artist_: Filter on artists who have created art for the card. You must \
specify a "list":#list of artists. A card matches if any artist in the list \
has drawn art for any printing of the card.
* _Expansion with Rarity_: Filter on the expansions and rarities in which the \
card has been printed. You must specify a "list":#list of expansion and \
rarity combinations. A card matches if it has been printed in one of the \
given expansion and rarity combinations. This filter considers all the \
expansions and rarities in which a card has ever been printed, and ignores \
the specific physical expansion information on the card. If you want to \
filter on a card's physical expansion information, use the \
_Physical Expansion_ filter.
* _Discipline with Level_: Filter on the discipline(s) listed on the card and \
their levels. You must specify a "list":#list of discipline and level \
combinations. A crypt card matches if any discipline listed on the card, and \
its listed level, match any combination in the list. This filter is intended \
to be used to find vampires -- presently, all library cards which have a \
discipline requirement have that discipline associated with them at the \
superior level. This filter treats different levels of the same discipline \
as different and unrelated disciplines, so a list which contains only the \
inferior version of a discipline will not match a card which has the \
superior version of that discipline.
* _Physical Expansion_: Filter on a card's expansion information. You must \
specify a "list":#list of expansions. A card matches if its listed expansion \
matches any expansion in the list. This is different from the \
_Expansion_with_Rarity_ filter, since it ignores rarities, and matches the \
specific physical expansion of the card, not the list of expansions in which \
the card has been printed.
* _Card Sets_: You must specify a "list":#list of card sets. A card matches \
if it belongs to at least one set in the list. This filter matches on name \
and expansion, so the filter will return as many copies of the card exist in \
this set, not the same number as in the listed sets.
* _In Card Sets In Use_: A card matches if it belongs to a card set which is \
marked as _In Use_ and is a child of the given card set. Like the \
_Card Sets_ filter, this matches solely on the card name and expansion, and \
the numbers are those for this card set, not the number in the in use children.
* _Card Count_: Filter on card count within the current card set or a \
different card set. You must specify a "list":#list of card counts, and a \
"list":#list of card sets.  A card matches if it belongs to one of the \
specified sets, and has a count within that set equal to any count in the list.
* _Card Function_: Filter on common card functions. You must specify a \
"list":#list of card functions. A card matches if it satisfies at least one \
function in the list.
* _Filter Group_: Add an additional filter group to the filter. See \
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

You can also use these filters in the "Card Lookup Dialog":#lookup during a card
set import -- they can assist you in finding matches for unknown cards.

Currently, the only way to filter on the properties of a merged vampire, such as
different discipline levels, is to filter on the card text.

h3(#card_set_filters). Card Set Filters

These filters apply to the card set list. The following basic filters are
supported.

* _Card Set Name_: Filter on the card set name. You must specify a \
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card \
set's name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Description_: Filter on the card set description. You must \
specify a "string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the \
card set's description. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Author_: Filter on the card set author. You must specify a \
"string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card set's \
author name. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Card Set Annotations_: Filter on the card set annotations. You must specify \
a "string":#string. A card set matches if the string appears in the card \
set's annotations. You can use % and _ as "wildcard":#wildcard characters.
* _Parent Card Set_: You must specify a "list":#list of card sets. A card set \
matches if any card set in the list is its parent set.
* _Card Set Marked as in Use_: A card set matches if it is marked as _In Use_.
* _Filter Group_: Add an additional filter group to the filter. See \
"Combining Basic Filters":#combining

When Sutekh displays card sets which match a filter, all the direct ancestors of
those sets are also displayed even if they do not match the filter themselves,
so that the matching sets can be shown in their correct position in the
hierarchy.


h3(#combining). Combining Basic Filters

You can combine filters by using filter groups to group the basic filters
together.

A Filter group can be set to any of the following options.

* _All of_: This filter matches only if every filter in the group matches.
* _Any of_: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the group \
matches.
* _Not all of_: This filter matches if at least one of the filters in the \
group doesn't match.
* _Not any of_: This filter matches only if none of the filters in the group \
match.

Each filter group can also contain further filters groups.  You can thus
construct complex queries by nesting multiple filter groups.


h3(#string). String filters

Several filters check a string which you specify against a particular text
property. They will match if the given string is a substring of the
property.

String filters are case-insensitive: for example, if you use the _Card Name_
filter, the string *the* will match both *Weigh the Heart* and
*Yuri, The Talon*.

String filters can also use two different wildcard characters:

*_* will match any single character. Thus *a_c* will match both *abc* and *aec*,
but not *abdc* or *abd*. *_* will never match the empty string, so *Th_e* will
not match *The*, but will match *Thee*

*%* will match any sequence of characters. So *a%c* will match any of *abc*,
*aec* or *abdegfthc*, but not *abdefg*. *%* will also match the empty string, so
*Th%e* will match both *The* and *Three*.

Wildcards can be used multiple times in the same filter string. So *a_b%e* will
match any of *acbde*, *aebe* or *aebfe*.

h3(#list). List filters

Several filters check a list of possible options which you specify against some
property. They will match if the value of the property matches any item in the
given list.

Thus, if you use the _Clan_ filter and specify both *Tremere* and *Toreador*, it
will match cards which list either of these clans.

h2(#analysis). Analysis Tools

h3(#cluster). Cluster Cards

The clustering tool attempts to group cards from a card list into sets
(clusters) of cards with similar properties. It is designed to allow you
to explore subsets of your cards, and perhaps to look for groups of cards which
might provide starting points for deck construction. The clustering tool is
currently quite slow, so be patient when waiting for large card lists to be
grouped (it will finish eventually).

When you open the clustering tool, you will be presented with three tabs:
_Select Columns_, _Settings_ and _Results_.

The _Select Columns_ tab is where you select the properties for the tool to
consider when grouping the cards. Properties are organised into categories for
ease of selection. If you are unsure which properties to select, start by
selecting the disciplines and clans which you find the most interesting.

In the _Settings_ tab, you can tweak the clustering algorithm parameters.
The tool implements K-means clustering using K-means++ to determine the
initial cluster centers, followed by Lloyd's method of iteratively refining the
clusters. Three parameters can be set:

* _Number of iterations_: Number of Lloyd refinement steps to perform. \
Setting more steps makes the clustering take longer, but setting fewer steps \
may result in a less optimal grouping. Ten steps should be sufficient for \
most cases.
* _Number of clusters_: By default, the tool creates one cluster per 80 cards \
(this being the size of a deck), but the number of clusters may also be set \
manually.
* _Distance measure_: Two distance metrics are currently supported. The \
Euclidean distance setting clusters using the usual N-dimensional vector \
space metric. The Sutekh distance metric modifies the Euclidean metric to \
make property values of -1 (used internally by Sutekh to mark costs of X and \
the ANY crypt group) close to all others and values of zero slightly further \
away than usual. If in doubt, leave the metric set to the Sutekh distance.

Once the property columns have been selected and the parameters set, use the
_Execute_ button to begin the clustering. When clustering is complete, the
_Results_ tab will be populated.

The results are presented as a table. Each row corresponds to a cluster of
cards. The first column contains checkboxes. Use these to select which clusters
to use to create card sets, then click the
_Make Cards Sets from Selected Clusters_ button at the bottom of the results.
The second column contains the cluster number, which enables you to determine
which clusters correspond to the created card sets. The third column shows how
many cards are present in each cluster, and the last lists the property
values of the cluster center (property values of zero are omitted).


h3(#stats). Clan Discipline Stats

This shows an analysis of all the different clans in the White Wolf
card list. For each clan, it displays the total number of vampires in the clan,
the sum of the vampires' capacities, and the most common disciplines. It also
shows the score for the disciplines, and various stats about how the disciplines
are distributed.

You can expand the tree view to show the details for each legal grouping
combination.

The score is intended to give you some indication of how common
disciplines are within the clan. Vampires without a discipline score 0 for that
discipline, vampires with the inferior discipline score 1 and vampires
with the superior discipline score 2.

Note that this will only include cards not legal for tournament play (such as
banned cards or storyline only cards) if the current profile for the white wolf
card list shows those cards.


h3(#exp_stats). Expansion Stats

This lists some statistics about the different expansions and rarities.

For each expansion, this lists the number of cards of each rarity. It also
notes which cards are found only in the preconstructed decks for that expansion
if needed. For each rarity, the individual cards are list, grouped according
to the current grouping of the white wolf card list.

Note that this will only include cards not legal for tournament play (such as
banned cards or storyline only cards) if the current profile for the white wolf
card list shows those cards.


h3(#compare). Compare with another Card Set

This tool compares the current card set with a different card set. It displays
which cards are common to both card sets, and lists the unique cards in each
card set.

By default, the tool considers the expansions of cards, and considers all cards
with the same name with different expansions as different.  You can change
this behaviour using the _Ignore Expansions_ checkbox when selecting a card set
for comparison. If selected, all cards of with the same name are considered
the same, regardless of expansion.

The display of the results uses the same grouping as the card set.

You can create card sets from each list of results using the 'Create Card Set
from this list' button.


h3(#analyze_deck). Analyze Deck

This tool examines a card set and displays various statistics about it which
are intended to give you some indication of how the card set will operate as a
deck.

It displays several tabs, each of which summarises different aspects
of the card set. The first tab summarises some basic information about the
entire set. The second tab implements Legbiter's Happy Family analysis for
the card set. The remaining tabs consider specific card types.

The happy family implementation allows you either to select the number of
disciplines to use, or to select the disciplines to consider manually.

h3(#test_indep). Test Card Set Independence

This tool tests the current card set against other card sets with the same
parent, and considers whether there are enough cards in the parent card set to
simultaneously construct all the selected sets. Multiple decks can be selected
from the list of card sets.

You can test the current card set against all sets with the same parent which
are marked as _In Use_ by checking the _Test against all card sets marked as in use_
checkbox when selecting decks for comparison. This checkbox overrides any
selected entries in the list.

By default the independence test is strict and checks whether the parent set
contains enough cards to build all the selected child sets with exactly the
card expansions specified. A less strict check which ignores expansions may
be selected by checking _Ignore card expansions_.

The first tab of the results displays the full list of cards of which there is a
shortage in the parent card set. For each selected set which includes any of
these cards, the list of cards relevant to that set is shown in a separate tab.

h3(#opening_hand). Simulate Opening Hand

This tool treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended
to give you some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition,
you can generate example opening hands and crypts by clicking the
_Draw sample hand_ button.

h3(#draw_prob). Card draw probabilities

This tool displays the probabilities of drawing the selected cards from the
library or the crypt. Unlike the _simulate opening hand_ tool, this
displays results for longer sequences of card draws.

The first row of the table shows the probabilities of drawing a single card in
the selected list. Sub-rows show the individual probabilities for each possible
combination of selected cards. The second row shows the probabilities of
drawing all possible combinations of two selected cards, etc..

Each probability cell in the table displays two values: the probability of
drawing at least that combination of cards, and the probability of drawing
exactly that combination of cards (shown in brackets).

The tool has the following settings:

* _columns in table_: Set the number of draws shown in the table. You must \
specify a number from one to eight (the default is eight). The first column \
shows the probabilities of drawing the given cards in your opening hand or \
crypt draw. Subsequent columns show the total probabilities of drawing the \
cards after you have drawn the number of extra cards shown in the column \
header.
* _step between columns_: Set the number of cards drawn between columns. You \
must specify a number from one to ten (the default is one).
* _cards of interest_: Set the number of rows in the table. You must specify \
a number from one to the total number of cards selected.

The selected changes are only applied when you press the the _recalculate table_
button.

h2(#profiles). Profiles

h3(#edit_profile). Editing Profiles

The *Edit Profile* dialog is an interface for creating new profiles of the
appropriate type, or to adjust the settings of the profile.

New Profiles can be created by selecting the *New Profile* option from the drop
down list. Otherwise, the profile to be edited can be selected. Profiles can
be renamed by editing the name field.

Changes are only applied if the *Save and Close* option is chosen. The changes
are applied to all panes used the edited profile.  Cancel discards all changes
made.

h3(#manage_profile). Managing Profiles

The Profile Management dialog is found under the "File":#main_file menu.

The dialog has tabs for each profile type. You can choose to either edit the
selected dialog, in which case the "Edit Profile":#edit_profile dialog
is opened with the selected profile, or delete the selected profile.

If a profile is deleted, any panes or card sets using that profile change
to the default profile.

h3(#ww_profile). White Wolf Card List Profile Options

You can set the following options for the white wolf card list in the profile:

* _Column mode_: This controls how information in the extra columns is \
displayed. You can choose to only show test, only show icons (if applicable) \
or to show both.
* _Extra columns_: Select which extra columns of data are shown. See the \
"Extra Columns (card sets)":#columns section for more details.
* _Extra levels_: Controls whether the card expansions are listed.
* _Group by_: Controls how the cards are grouped together. See the \
"Card Grouping":#grouping section for more details.
* _Hide cards not legal for tournament play_: Controls whether cards flagged \
as not legal for tournament play (i.e. banned or storyline only cards) are \
shown in the list.
* _White Wolf Card List Count Mode_: By default, the White Wolf card list \
doesn't show a count for cards. This option allows you to choose between the \
default _Don't show card counts_ mode, _Show counts for each distinct card_ \
and _Show counts for each expansion_. In _Show counts for each distinct card_, \
each distinct card has a count of 1, but expansions aren't counted. This \
can be useful for determining statistics about the cards and so on, While \
in the _how counts for each expansion_ mode, each printed expansion has a \
count of 1 (the _Unspecified Expansion_ entries aren't counted).
* _Show icons for grouping_: Controls whether icons are shown with the group name.

h4(#grouping). Card Grouping

By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types.   You can
change the grouping as part of the pane profile.

The following groupings are available:

* _Clans and Creeds_: Group cards by the Clan(s) or Creed(s) listed on the \
card.  The Imbued Creeds are treated as if they were Vampire Clans.
* _Disciplines and Virtues_: Group cards by the Discipline(s) or Virtue(s) \
listed on the card. The Imbued Virtues are treated as if they were Vampire \
Disciplines.
* _Disciplines (by level)  and Virtues_: Group cards by the Discipline(s) or \
Virtue(s) listed on the card. This distinguishes between inferior and \
superior levels of the discipline on vampires, but otherwise is the same \
as the _Disciplines and Virtues_ grouping.
* _Crypt or Library_: Split the card list into crypt and library cards.
* _Card Type_: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping \
treats multi-type cards, such as *Action Modifier/Combat* cards as members of \
both the *Action Modifier* and the *Combat* groups.
* _Expansion_: Group by the expansions in which the cards have been printed.
* _Rarity_: Group the cards by the published rarity.
* _Sect_: Group cards by the Sects listed on the card.
* _Title_: Group cards by the political titles listed on the card.
* _Cost_: Group cards by the cost of the card.
* _Multi Card Type_: Behaves like the _Card Type_ grouping, but treats \
multi-type cards as members of separate types. Thus *Action Modifier/Combat* \
will appear as a separate group, and cards of that type will not be listed \
in the *Action Modifier* and *Combat* groups.
* _Group_: Group the cards by their crypt group.
* _Group pairs_: Group cards into pairs of adjacent groups. Cards marked as \
*Any Group* are considered to belong to all group pairs.
* _Artist_: Group the cards by their artists.
* _Keyword_: Group the cards by the keywords associated with them.

h4(#columns). Extra Columns (card sets)

By default, Sutekh only shows card names in the White Wolf Card List, and card
names and card counts in other card set card lists.  You can select additional
columns to display as part of the pane profile.

The possible extra columns are:

* _Clans and Creeds:_ Show the Clans or Creeds listed on the card.
* _Group:_ Show the group number for the card.
* _Disciplines and Virtues:_ Show the Disciplines or Virtues listed on the card.
* _Card Type:_ Show the card type.
* _Expansions:_ Show the expansions in which the card has been printed.
* _Capacity or Life:_ Show the capacity associated with the card, or \
its life.
* _Sect_: Show the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Show the political titles listed on the card, if it is a crypt \
card.  Titles listed on library cards will not be shown.
* _Card Text_: Show the text printed on the card.
* _Cost_: Show the cost of the card, together with the cost type.

You can sort the display by a particular column by clicking on the column
header. Click on the same header repeatedly to toggle between ascending and
descending order.

Cards which have equal values within the column selected for sorting are further
sorted by the card name. Because the different cost types aren't comparable, if
you choose to sort by cost, cards will be grouped by cost type first and sorted
within those types.

If you have downloaded the icons from the White Wolf site, you will be able to
toggle the display between the _Show Icons and Names_, _Show Text only_ and
_Show Icons only_ options using the combo box. This setting will
affect all selected columns that can use icons.

h3(#cardset_profile). Card Set Profile Options

You can set the following options or a card set or frame profile:

* _Cards To Show_: Set which cards are displayed. The options are:
** _This Set Only_: Show only the cards in this card set.
** _Show All Cards_: Show all the cards in the White Wolf list. Cards not in \
this card set will have a count of 0.
** _Show all cards in parent card set_: Show all the cards in this card set, \
as well as any cards in the parent card set that are not in this card set.
** _Show all cards in child card sets_: Show all the cards in this card set, \
as well as any cards in those child card sets marked as _In Use_ that are not \
in this card set.
* _Column mode_: This controls how information in the extra columns is \
displayed. You can choose to only show test, only show icons (if applicable) \
or to show both.
* _Extra columns_: Select which extra columns of data are shown. See the \
"Extra Columns (card sets)":#columns section for more details.
* _Extra levels_: Specify what additional information is displayed below the \
card names in the tree. The options are:
** _Show No Children_: Display nothing below the card name.
** _Show Expansions_: Show the expansions of the cards, and a card count for \
each expansion.
** _Show Child Card Sets_: Show the card counts for child card sets marked as \
_In Use_.
** _Show Expansions and Child Card Sets_: Show expansions, and within each \
expansion show counts for child card sets marked as _In Use_.
** _Show Child Card Sets and Expansions_: Show child card sets marked \
as _In Use_, and for each child card set show expansion counts.
* _Group by_: Controls how the cards are grouped together. See the \
"Card Grouping":#grouping section for more details.
* _Hide cards not legal for tournament play_: Controls whether cards flagged \
as not legal for tournament play (i.e. banned or storyline only cards) are \
shown in the list.
* _Show icons for grouping_: Controls whether icons are shown with the group \
name.
* _Parent Count Mode_: Specify how the _Parent count_ column is displayed \
in card sets with a parent set. The options are:
** _Ignore Parent_: Hide the parent count column.
** _Parent count_: Show only the parent count. If the count for this \
card set exceeds the parent count, this number is shown in red.
** _Parent Minus this set_: Show the difference between the parent count and \
this card set's count. If this number is negative, it is shown in red.
** _Parent Minus Sets in Use_: Show the difference between the parent count \
and the total count in all the card sets marked as _In Use_. If this number \
is negative, it is shown in red.
* _Show icons for the grouping_: Toggle whether icons are shown for the top \
level grouping (when available).

h4(#different_profiles). The Different Profiles

The display of a cardset is deteremined by 3 different profiles. These are the
"local profile", the "pane profile" and the "card set profile". Any options
that aren't set by one of these profiles is taken from the *Default profile*.

The *cardset profile* is used for any copy of the given card set, when it
is first opened. If multiple copies of a card set are open, they all use the
same *cardset profile*, and changing this will effect all open copies of the
card set.

The *pane profile* is used to override settings in the *cardset profile* and
save them across sessions. Pane profile settings are lost when the specific
pane is specifically closed, but, as long as the pane is kept open, they
are saved and restored as needed.

The *local profile* is used to set temporary options on the specific pane
which override the other profiles. These setting are temporary, and are never
saved.

h3(#cs_profile). CardSet List Profile Options

The following options can be set for the card set list profile

* _Extra columns_: Select which extra columns of data are shown. See the \
"Extra Columns (card set list)":#cs_columns section for more details.

h4(#cs_columns). Extra Columns (card set list)

Only card set names are shown in the card set list by default as well.  You can
select additional columns to display as part of the card set list profile.

The possible extra columns are:

* _Author_: Show the card set author.
* _Description_: Show the card set description.
* _Total cards_: Show the total number of cards in the card set.
* _Crypt_: Show the number of crypt cards in the card set.
* _Library_: Show the number of library cards in the card set.
* _All Children_: Show the number of child card sets each card set has
* _In-Use Children_: Show the number of child card sets marked as in use.

The display can be sorted on these columns by clicking on the column headers.
